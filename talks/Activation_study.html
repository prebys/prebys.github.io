There were disturbing levels of activation during the last access into the
Booster. &nbsp;This has caused some worries, particularly in the RF group.
&nbsp;To initially address this problem, I've tried to identify problem areas,
and looked at their typical loss levels in order to arrive at some new limits.
&nbsp;I've used data from our standard Booster surveys, and selected the
following dates:<br>
<ul>
  <li>8/28/03 - Just before MiniBooNE started running in earnest</li>
  <li>4/10/03 &nbsp;and 4/29/03 - Corresponding to some of our best running</li>
  <li>6/17/03 - Our most recent access</li>
</ul>
All of these surveys had similar cooldown times, and I haven't applied any
cooldown correction. &nbsp;I've corrected all data to mR/hr@1f as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>1ft measurements - no correction.</li>
  <li>Contact measurements EXCEPT short straights - divide by 5.</li>
  <li>Contact measurements at short straights - divide by 2. &nbsp;This is
because the contact point is on the stand, not on the beampipe itself.</li>
</ul>
Below is shown the data for all points where the corrected reading is greater
than 100 mR/hr<br>
