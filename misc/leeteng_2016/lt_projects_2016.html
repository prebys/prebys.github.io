<h2><a name="argonne"></a>Argonne Projects</h2>
<h3>1.&nbsp; Characterization of an In-situ metrology setup for the APS Modular Deposition System (MDS)<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:assoufid@APS.ANL.GOV">Lahsen Assoufid</a></span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:jayson.shiau@gmail.com">Jayson Shiau</a>, Northern Illinois University<br>
</span></h3>The candidate will participate, within a team of experts,
in testing and evaluating the performance of a high speed
interferometer to be used for the in-situ metrology subsystem of the
Advanced Photon Source' (APS) newly-acquired Modular Deposition System
(MDS). The MDS is a sophisticated thin film sputtering tool designed
for R&amp;D and fabrication of next-generation thin film optics for the
APS beamlines. In-situ metrology will allow the system's operator to
monitor the surface quality of an optic after each predefined number of
successive coating and figure-correction steps, without removing it out
of the vacuum chamber and disturbing the mirror in-situ mounting and
setup.<br>
<br>Requirements:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
Mechanical engineering and design or physic</li>
  <li>Basics optics</li>
  <li>Computer programing in Python, Matlab or IDL.</li>
</ul>


<h3>2. Digital RF Technology on a MicroTCA Platform</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:berenc@APS.ANL.GOV">Tim Berenc</a></span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:eugenewu2017@U.NORTHWESTERN.EDU">Eugene Wu</a>, Northwestern University</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>Radio-frequency (rf)
systems employ feedback control to regulate both the amplitude and
phase of the accelerating voltage in a particle accelerator. The
Advanced Photon Source is exploring FPGA-based digital rf technology
using a MicroTCA platform (Micro-Telecommunications Computing
Architecture) for various rf feedback applications.<br>
<br>
This hands-on project will entail implementing an adaptive notch filter
[1-2] with a MicroTCA system consisting of baseband analog-to-digital
(A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converter FPGA Mezzanine Cards (FMCs)
and a FPGA-based MicroTCA FMC carrier board. Additionally, a high-speed
A/D and D/A rf transceiver board will be explored for intermediate
frequency (IF) or direct rf sampling applications.<br>
<br>
This is a great opportunity to be exposed to rf systems for particle
accelerators and get practical hands-on experience with modern
high-speed digital computing platform technology being used in a wide
range of industry applications.<br><br>
Requirements:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Electrical engineering &amp; computer sciences student with
coursework in feedback control theory, digital signal processing, and
experience with FPGA programming.</li>
  <li>Strong motivation and independence in experiment and data analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.&nbsp; Tuning Software for ATLAS<br>
</h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:brahim@ANL.GOV">Brahim Mustapha</a> and Clay Dickerson </span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:raheemb@PRINCETON.EDU">Raheem Barnett</a>, Princeton University<br>
 </span></h3>
We have recently developed an online model for the tuning and operation
of the ATLAS linac. ATLAS is a DOE National User Facility at Argonne&#8217;s
Physics Division. The online model is based on the beam dynamics code
TRACK, which has also been developed at the Physics Division. While the
model is ready it is yet to be tested both offline and online. Offline
tests are to check the software before testing it online for actual
beam tuning in the linac. The interested student will participate in
these offline and online tests as well as possible improvements in the
software.<br>

<h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Requirements:<br></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Strong physics background with analytical and computing skills.</li>
  <li>Preferences: Basic beam physics knowledge and familiarity with Linux/Unix operating systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.&nbsp; Bend Magnet Heat Loads &amp; Out of Orbit Scenarios<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:timvalicenti@GMAIL.COM">Timothy Valicenti</a>, Brown University</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>This project will focus on the effect that missteering will have on the synchrontron radiation produced by bunches of<br>
electrons in the APS to be used to optimize the design of the mechanical components for the multi-bend achromat (MBA)<br>
lattice in the upgrade of the APS.<br>
<br><br>
<h3>5. Simulations and Measurements of RF Accelerating Cavities<br>
</h3><h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:waldschm@APS.ANL.GOV">Geoff Waldschmidt</a></span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:apizzuto@LUC.EDU">Alexander Pizzuto</a>, Loyola University</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br>The project will consist of
electromagnetic simulations of accelerating cavities as well as rf
measurements. Simulations will be used to characterize the performance
parameters of the device and to evaluate the experimental
setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rf measurements will be performed to verify
simulation results and assist in the measurement of higher order modes
of the device.&nbsp; Ultimately, the measurements will be used to
evaluate an accelerating structure to determine the consequence of
cavity dislocations due to gravitational effects followed by an
evaluation of the structure after modifications have been made.&nbsp;
An automated, software-controlled data acquisition system will be used
to acquire data and to post-process the results.&nbsp; <br>

LCLS-II is a next generation x-ray free electron laser to be constructed<br>

at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California. This linear<br>

accelerator will be built based on superconducting RF technology.<br>

Fermilab is responsible for the design of the accelerator cryomodules<br>

and assembling and testing half of the 35 planned units. A dedicated<br>

facility to cool down each cryomodule built at Fermilab to 2 Kelvin and<br>

characterize their performance will be commissioned and begin operation<br>

in spring/summer 2016 with the arrival of the first prototype<br>

cryomodule. Graphical interfaces to run and monitor the tests as well as<br>

software tools to aid in analysis of the test data and summarize the<br>

results need to be developed.<br>

<br>

Requirements:<br>

<h3>4.&nbsp; Diffusion measurement with transverse beam echoes<br>
</h3>





<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:tsen@FNAL.GOV">Tanaji Sen</a><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:liy@CARLETON.EDU">Yuan Shen Li</a>, Carleton College<br>
</span></h3>

Generating beam echoes is a novel method of quickly
measuring beam diffusion. This can be done with a pulsed quadrupole and
a measurement time of about a thousand turns. This contrasts with
conventional collimator scans which can take hours.&nbsp; Once proven
to be
effective, this would be applicable to all future hadron storage ring
accelerators. The project will focus on simulating the feasibility of
generating these echoes in Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA),
which is being built at Fermilab. It will include developing theory and
simulation tools
for the experiment. Several machine configurations will be examined
including the different nonlinear lenses and the implications of
coupling. Different quadrupole pulse sequences such as multiple short
pulses with alternating polarities will be studied for generating
larger amplitude echoes and greater sensitivity to diffusion. A basic
familiarity with beam optics (learned at the USPAS) and use of an
optics program will be needed. <br>
