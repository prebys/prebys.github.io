<h1>Notes on Java Files to Study AC Dipole Transmission for Mu2e<br>
</h1>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(last updated April 9, 2014)</span><br>
<br>These are notes on a suite of Java files I wrote to study details
of bunch transmission through the Mu2e beam line extinction system<br>
<br>
<h2>Working Area<br>
</h2>All source, input, and output files are kept in /Users/prebys/GoogleDrive/eclipse/workspace<br>
<br>
<h2>Main Classes<br>
</h2>The study is based on three major classes:<br>
<ul>
  <li>BeamBunch (abstract):&nbsp; This class returns a longitudinal
probability distribution function (PDF) for a bunch. Derived classes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>BeamBunchGaussian: Gaussian bunch</li>
    <li>BeamBunchLookup: Bunch based on a lookup table.&nbsp; Current best lookup table is time_distribution_new.csv<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>KickerWave (abstract): This class returns a wave function
corresponding to the deflection field of the AC diple.&nbsp; In
general, it's normalized to return a value of 2 (full extinction) at
the boundaries of a specified transmission window. Derived classes:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>KickerSineWave: simple sine wave</li>
    <li>KickerModifiedSineWave:&nbsp; sine wave plus a higher harmonic.&nbsp; This is the base line for Mu2e.</li>
    <li>KickerMECOWave: Original MECO waveform</li>
    <li>KickerUCIWave: Later proposed alternative by UCI</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Aperture:&nbsp; This defines the aperture. It returns a
transmission probability as a function of normalized amplitude, where 1
corresponds to the beam being centered on the edge of the collimator.
For backward compatibility, it has two modes, based on which
constructor is used</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Gaussian mode: If constructed with Aperture(double
emittance95/admittance), it will create a Gausian transverse profile,
based on the ration between the 95% emittance and the beam admittance.</li>
    <li>Lookup mode: If constructed with Aperture(File lookupFile), it
will look up the transmission as a function of normalized
displacement.&nbsp; Current best transmission file is
transmission_lookup.csv.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
There are a number of analysys files using these classes. Their behavior can generally be inferred from the name.<br>
