<h1>Notes on Updating MacOS</h1>
<h2>El Capitan (10.11) to Sierra (10.12)</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
I had a very bad experience with a Fermilab "official version" of an
OS, so since then I always just use the vanilla Apple install from the
App store.<br>
<br>
Installation went remarkably quickly compared to some of the previous
upgrades, and there are no more big changes to access rules that cause
so much problems a couple of versions ago, so there shouldn't be big
problems.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Here are some specific issues afterwards...<br>
<br>
<h3>Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client</h3>
Before you upgrade, make sure you have the <a href="http://networking.fnal.gov/vpn/">latest version</a>!
(3.1.04063).&nbsp; I had an older version, which the upgrade
broke.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're at home, make sure you use the old version
to download the new version, because you won't be able to later. <br>
<br>
<h3>Things that Worked Fine</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All the normal stuff (browsers, editors, Office, etc)</li>
  <li>TexWorks. I already did the following workaround from the previous upgrade</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Go into "Preferences-&gt;typesetting" and add "/Library/TeX/texbin/" to the search path.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <li>Parallels 11<br>
  </li>
  <li>MADX</li>
  <li>ACNET<br>
  </li>

</ul>
I don't run local versions of MARS, ART, GEANT4, or Synergia at this time.<br>

<h3>ROOT</h3>It's always kind of a pain to get ROOT to work properly
after an upgrade.&nbsp; This is because the update upgrades Xcode, but
not the command line tools.&nbsp; To fix this, you need to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Launch XCode</li>
  <ul>
    <li>It will tell you it needs to download and install components.&nbsp; Let it do so</li>
    <li>Quit<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Install the command line tools</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you do the recommended checks, it will tell you they're already there, but this is a lie.<br>
</li>
    <li>Go <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more/">here</a>. Log in with your Apple credentials</li>

    <li>Download the latest command line tools</li>
    <li>Install them</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Download the latest ROOT from <a href="https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root">here</a></li>
  <li>To be on the safe side, delete any .so files in your area and let it rebuild them.<br>
  </li>

</ul>
<h3>XQuartz/ssh</h3>
After the upgrade, I found that ssh no was no longer forwarding X11 connections.&nbsp; Reinstalling XQuartz fixed the problem.<br>
<br>
<h3>g4Beamline/histoRoot</h3>The g4beamline executables work
fine.&nbsp; The visualizer has a bug that won't work with XQuartz newer
than 2.7.8, which still works under Sierra.&nbsp; Tom Roberts is
working on a fix.<br>
<br>
histoRoot works fine<br>
<h3>MathType</h3>

MathType for Mac continues to only work with Office 2011.&nbsp; I found
that the first time I used it after the upgrade, it had to download a
bunch of fonts (around five).&nbsp; After that it worked fine.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
