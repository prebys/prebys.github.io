<br>These are
some notes I've put together based on the issues that have come up
again and again over the years.&nbsp; It's mostly aimed at summer
interns, but other newcomers might find it useful as well.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

<h2><a name="Caveat:_Beware_of_stale_information_"></a>Caveat: Beware of stale information!<br>
</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Computing is constantly changing, and
the lab is not particularly diligent when it comes to clearing stale
information off of its websites.&nbsp; If
you find yourself looking at a page related to computing where the last
update is more than two years ago, chances are very good it's wrong!<br>
<br>
To the best of my knowledge, the advice I'm giving here is valid on the <a href="#date">date
above</a>. If you're stumbling onto this page years later than that date,&nbsp;
then do&nbsp; yourself a favor and move on!<br>
<br>
I'll try to point out things that have changed within the last couple
of years, for which you're likely to get stale information elsewhere.<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h2><a name="Computing_Rules"></a>Computing Rules</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Fermilab networks and computing
resources are there to support work related to the lab's mission.&nbsp;
Reasonable personal use is permitted, provided that it doesn't use
significant time or resources.&nbsp; You can find the full computing
policy <a href="http://security.fnal.gov/Policies/cpolicy.html">here</a>, but the most important thing is to absolutely avoid the "four ps":<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">profit</span> - no commercial activity of any kind may be conducted on Fermilab computers.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">pornography</span> - I hope that one's self explanatory.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">piracy</span> - no attempt to violate any copyright or licensing agreements will be tolerated! <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">politics</span> - As a
government funded organization, none of our resources, including
computing, can be used in support of partisan political activity.&nbsp;
This includes lab affiliated email addresses and lab sponsored FaceBook
groups.</li>
</ul>Violation of these rules can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.&nbsp; <br>

</div>
<h2><a name="Equipment_"></a>Equipment<br>
</h2>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Mentors and interns should be in touch
with each other well before the beginning of the internship to
determine what, in any, computer equipment will be required.&nbsp; It's the mentor's
responsibility to see that these needs are met. We have some spare
computers that are available for use, but we find that in most cases,
students are most comfortable using their own computers, although they
may want a larger monitor and external keyboard/mouse.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In general, the lab supports Unix/Linux, MS Windows, and MacOSX, and you
will likely encounter an eclectic mix of those systems while you're here.<br>
</div>
<h2><a name="Network_Access"></a>Network Access</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">When you first arrive at Fermilab, you
can connect to the "guest" network by answering a few questions, or to
"eduroam" if you have an account, but these are outside of our firewall
and have limited access.&nbsp; Once you have an ID number and services account, follow <a href="https://fermi.service-now.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB0011206">these instructions</a>
to register your device for the "fgz" network, which is inside the
firewall and will give you full access to lab resources.&nbsp; If
you're working
from outside the lab, you will need to follow the <a href="#Remote_Access_VPN">Remote Access
instructions</a> below.<br>
<br>Once you have "fgz" access, make sure to remove "guest"&nbsp; and
"eduroam" from your connection list, as accidentally connecting to them
will significantly limit your access to lab resources!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note!</span>&nbsp; The lab is <span style="font-style: italic;">extremely</span>
fussy about what it lets onto the network and is constantly scanning
all computers for vulerabilities.&nbsp; For example, remote login and
screen sharing servers will result in your computer being blocked
unless you take steps to configure them properly. Unless you really
need them, it's best to just turn them off while you're here.&nbsp; If
you get an email warning about a blocking event, you need to fix the
problem <span style="font-style: italic;">and follow the link to verify that you've addressed it</span>.&nbsp; Otherwise, your computer will be auto-blocked.&nbsp; If you have questions or problems with this, visit the <a href="#Getting_Help">Help Desk in Wilson Hall</a>.<br>
</div>
<h2><a name="Computer_Accounts"></a>Standard Computer Accounts</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">There are several basic accounts you
will need to work at Fermilab.&nbsp; Some of these will be covered
during your onboarding orientation, but they sometimes leave <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> important things out, so please read this.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
On your first day, you will be given an accounts on <a href="https://wd5.myworkday.com/fermilab/login.flex">Fermiworks</a>&nbsp;
and <a href="https://hrweb.fnal.gov:8021/psp/FermiSelfServicePRD/?cmd=login&amp;languageCd=ENG&amp;">Fermi Employee Self Service</a>. You will use these to enter some personal information, fill out your
W-9, and set up direct deposit, and then you will likely never use them again during your time
here.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="services_account"></a>The most important account</span>
you
will get at Fermilab is your "services account", <span style="font-weight: bold;">yourusername@services.fnal.gov</span>.&nbsp; This is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">LDAP</a>
username and password that will used to authenticate you on a wide
variety of lab services everything, including SharePoint, your time
card (more
about this
in a minute), your email, and most importantly, the <a href="https://fermi.service-now.com/">Service Now page</a>, where
you can request any other accounts or computing services you might need.&nbsp; You can't
really do anything until you get this account.&nbsp; Your services
account should be set up automatically, and they should tell you about
it at orientiation.&nbsp; If they don't, then go immediately to the <a href="#Getting_Help">Service Desk</a> and tell them you need
one.&nbsp; Your services account will have a unique username ("<span style="font-weight: bold;">yourusername</span>" in the on this page), which
will also be used for other accounts.&nbsp; In addition to your
services account, you will automatically be given<br>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> yourusername@fnal.gov</span> email
address: This will be forwarded to your personal email.&nbsp; You can
request an actual email address, but it will go away when your
internship is over, so it's best to keep using your own in most
cases.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> yourusername@FNAL.GOV</span> <a href="https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/">kerberos</a> principle: This will be used to authenticate you on all <a href="#Access_to_Unix_Services">unix/linux systems</a> at the lab.</li>
  <li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">FERMI\yourusername</span>
Windows domain account. You can use this to log into any Windows
computer at the lab, and it is also used to authenticate you on <a href="#Shared_Disks">Samba shared disks</a>. This account will be automatically created, but you may need to call or visit the <a href="#Getting_Help">Help Desk</a> to activate it.<br>
  </li>

</ul><br>
<h2><a name="Getting_Help"></a>Getting Help (Service Desk, Service Now)</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If you have computer problems, you can request help by opening a ticket at the <a href="https://fermi.service-now.com/">Service Now</a>
webpage using your services account, but it's usually more effective to
call or visit the Service Desk, and the number is 630-840-2345.&nbsp; It's
located on the ground floor of Wilson Hall, in the North cross over,
across from the Credit Union.<br>
</div>
<br>

<h2><a name="Exchange_Server"></a>Exchange Server (Calendar, Mail, Office, etc)</h2>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Major changes recently!</span><br>
<br>
The lab now outsources most of its
basic IT services to an offsite Exchange server, hosted by
Microsoft.&nbsp; In particualar, this is where Email is hosted, as well
as the calendar that the lab uses for both personal scheduling and to
schedule things like meeting rooms.<br>
<br>
You can access this server directly by going to
<a href="http://outlook.office365.com/">http://outlook.office365.com/</a> and log in by entering
"yourusername@services.fnal.gov" as the user and your services password as
the password.<br>
<br>
You can also sync the system to your own Outlook, as well as various
MacOS, iOS, and Android mail and calendar clients by following the
instructions <a href="https://fermi.service-now.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB0011823">here</a>.<br>
</div>

<br>

<h2><a name="Time_Cards"></a>Time Cards</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Employees need to fill out time cards
every week.&nbsp; You do this using the "kronos" timekeeping service,
which you can access <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ftl/">here</a>.
Log in with your services credentials.&nbsp; There is an HTML interface
at the right which will work from any browser, but it's a bit annoying
to use.<br>
<br>
The Java interface is better, but can be a bit fussy, and the Kronos
site makes it extra confusing.&nbsp; I've only made it work with Safari
and Explorer.&nbsp; First, go <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp">here</a> to verify your version of Java, update if necessary, and make sure it's enabled. <br>
<br>
To get Java Kronos to work, do the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Safari: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the <a href="http://timecard.fnal.gov/java">Kronos log in</a> page, and log in with your services password.</li>
    <li>You will get an error in red telling you that Java is not
installed, and a link to download a very outdated version. Do not do
this!</li>
    <li>Go to "Preferences-&gt;Security-Plug-in Settings-&gt;Java", and turn fermilab.kronos.net to "On".&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Explorer:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the <a href="http://timecard.fnal.gov/java">Kronos log in</a> page, and log in with your services password.</li>
    <li>You will get an error in red telling you that Java is not
installed, and a link to download a very outdated version. Do not do
this!</li>
    <li>Go to "Tools-&gt;Compatibility View Settings".&nbsp; You should see "kronos.net" in the top line.&nbsp; Click "Add" and close.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

In both cases, you will have to OK a number of splashes before Java actually runs the first time.<br>
<br>
I've been told that you can get it to work with Firefox on Linux using the <a href="http://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/IcedTea-Web">Iced Tea plugin</a>, but I have not personally made this work.<br>
<br>
Go to "My information-&gt;My timecard" to access&nbsp; your time card, then enter your arrival and departure time each day.<br>
<br>
All interns are authorized to work 8 hours per day, 40 hours per week
(July 4th is an upaid holiday).&nbsp; Any deviation from that requires
supervisor approval beforehand.&nbsp; You will automatically be given a
half hour unpaid lunch, so adjust your arrival and/or departure times
accordingly.<br>
<br>
Important! Once you have entered your time, do "Approvals-&gt;approve" to send the timecard to your supervisor.<br>
<br>
Your timecard must be filled out by 10AM Monday morning so that your
supervisor can approve it.&nbsp; The work week runs from Monday through
Sunday, so if you wait until Monday morning to fill it out, you need to
select "previous week" in the pulldown (I still make this mistake all the time)!<br>
</div>
<br>
<h2><a name="Printing"></a>Printing</h2>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">To access lab printers, you must be
inside the firewall (verify that you're connected to "fgz" rather than
"guest").&nbsp; Find the name of the printer, which is usually printed
somewhere on or near it, then go to <a href="http://fermiprint.fnal.gov/Managedprint/Managedprint.html">this page</a> for instructions about how to add it to your system.<br>
<br>
Note:&nbsp; I've found that if you already have a printer of the same
brand as the one you're trying to install, it can screw up the
automated printer installation (it appears to run successfully, but
then no printer is added).&nbsp; If this happens, submit a help desk
ticket at <a href="https://fermi.service-now.com/">SericeNow</a> and they will be able to solve the problem for you.&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<h2><a name="Shared_Disks"></a>Shared Disks</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Many groups at the lab use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_%28software%29">Samba</a>
shared disks.&nbsp; These are accessed with your Windows FERMI
domain credentials.&nbsp; The two most commonly accessed Samba servers
are <span style="font-weight: bold;">filesrv01.fnal.gov</span>, which has experimental data areas and web space,
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">beamssrv1.fnal.gov</span>, which has lots of stuff for the accelerator
division.&nbsp; These can only be accessed inside the firewall or via a
<a href="#Remote_Access_VPN">VPN</a>.<br>
<br>
Note that in many cases, you'll need to be given permission to access
shared disk.&nbsp; These are usually granted to members of a particular
project or experiment.&nbsp; Go to the <a href="Affiliation%5CExperiment%20Computing%20Account%20Request">service now page</a>
-&gt; "Request New/Renew Accounts"-&gt;"Affiliation\Experiment
Computing Account Request", enter your information and select the
appropriate experiment/project from the pulldown.&nbsp; If it's not
there, then you need to find out who adminsters the disk and get him or
her to grant you access.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To access these disks<br>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>On MS Windows</li>
  <ul>
    <li>open
a browser window and enter the server name in the address bar preceded
by "\\", e.g. "\\beamsrv1.fnal.gov".&nbsp; You can add more to the path
if you want.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>You will be asked to authenticate with your Windows credentials.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Use "FERMI\yourusername" as the username</li>
    <li>Once you do this, the server will appear under "Network" in your file browser<br>
    </li>

  </ul>
  <li>On MacOSX</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the Finder</li>
    <li>Do "Go-&gt;Connect to Server..." and ender the servername,
preceded by "smb://", e.g. "smb://beamsrv1.fnal.gov".&nbsp; You can add
more of the path if you want</li>
    <li>You will be asked to authenticate with your Windows credentials.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Use "FERMI\yourusername" as the username</li>
    <li>Once you access the server, the disk you access will show up as
a mounted disk, and be accessible from your desktop or via /Volumes/<br>
    </li>

  </ul>
  <li>On Linux</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Use "smbclient" or "smbmount", as described <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SMB-HOWTO-8.html">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Use the options "--workgroup=FERMI --user=yourusername".&nbsp; It will prompt you for your password.</li>
  </ul>
</ul><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Sometimes, you will have access to a shared subdirectory, but not one
or more of the directories above it.&nbsp; In those cases, you will have to
enter the full path to access the area,
rather than access the top directory and navigate down.&nbsp; <br>

<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent change: </span>AFS is no longer supported at the lab, so if you see instructions to AFS mount anything, once again, ignore them.<br>
</div>
<h2><a name="Personal_Webspace"></a>Personal Webspace</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Major changes recently!</span><br>
<br>
Everyone at the lab has a personal web area, that can be accessed in
several ways.&nbsp; In the examples below, replace "y" with the first
letter of your <span style="font-weight: bold;">yourusername</span>.<br>
<br>
You can access it via a <a href="#Shared_Disks">Samba shared disk</a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">\\filesrv01.fnal.gov\publicweb\y\yourusername</span> <br>
<br>
If you have an account on the <a href="#Access_to_Unix_Services">unix cluster</a>, you can access it as<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">/publicweb/y/yourusername</span> <br>
<br>
or as the <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">~mydisk/public_html</span><br>
subdirectory of your main account<br>
<br>
The space is accessed via the web as:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">http://home.fnal.gov/~yourusername/</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>Your personal webspace is accessible from outside the firewall, so
be careful what you put there and be especially sure you're adhering to
the <a href="#Computing_Rules">computing rules</a>!<br>
</div>
<h2><a name="Certificate_Authentication"></a>Certificate Authentication</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Major changes recently!</span> <br>
<br>
Some web pages at the lab, particularly
the Document Database (DocDB) use CILogon certificates for
access.&nbsp; You can find instructions for using these <a href="https://fermi.service-now.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB0011531">here</a>.<br>
<br>
Ignore any instructions involving KCA certificates, as they are no longer used at the lab.<br>
</div>

<h2><a name="Remote_Access_VPN"></a>Remote Access (VPN)</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Many resources at the lab, including
shared <a href="#Shared_Disks">Samba disks</a> and a number of the web pages, are blocked by the
lab's firewall.&nbsp; To access them from outside, you will need to use
a virtual private network (VPN) client.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The lab is set up to work with Cisco AnyConnect, which uses "split
stream"; that is, only fnal domain addresses are routed through the
VPN.&nbsp; Go <a href="http://networking.fnal.gov/vpn/">here</a> for
instructions on downloading and installing the software.&nbsp; The
Catch-22 is that before you have the VPN installed, you only access the
download link from inside the firewall.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Once you have the software installed, you can connect using your services account credentials.&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<h2><a name="Access_to_Unix_Services"></a>Access to Unix Resources</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Most of the "serious computing" at the
lab is done on linux/unix servers or clusters.&nbsp; Ask your mentor or
supervisor if you will need access to any of these. If the answer is is
no, you can ignore this section.<br>
<br>
If you need to use unix resources, you should request an account on the central unix cluster, by going to the <a href="Affiliation%5CExperiment%20Computing%20Account%20Request">service now page</a> -&gt; "Request New/Renew Accounts"-&gt;"Requst FNALU Account".&nbsp; Your supervisor will need to approve the request.<br>
<br>
All unix systems at the lab are accessed with your kerberos principle,
but you will need to be granted access to particular machines.&nbsp;
Your mentor/supervisor should arrange for this.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Note that some unix systems are only accessible inside the
firewall.&nbsp; To access them from outside the lab, you will either
have to use VPN, or connect first to FNALU.<br>
<br>
To use unix services, you will need Kerberos tools and an xwindows
server on your computer.&nbsp; You can then connect or copy files with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh">secure shell (ssh)</a> or <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp">secure copy (scp)</a>, respectively.<br>
<br>This is a bit different on each operating system.&nbsp; These
instructions assume you have administrator privileges on your computer.
Note that in all these examples, the capital letters in
"yourusername@FNAL.GOV" are important.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">MacOSX</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The kerberos tools are built-in, but you should download the correct krb5.conf configuration file from <a href="http://computing.fnal.gov/authentication/krb5conf/">here</a>
and copy it to the /etc/ directory on your main hard disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you're doing this from the Finder rather than a terminal window, the
/etc/ directory is hidden, so you will need to do "Go-&gt;Go to
folder..." and enter /etc.&nbsp; It's probably a good idea to make a
backup copy of the version of krb5.conf that's already there before
replacing. <br>
<br>
If you don't already have XQuartz, download it from <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">here</a> and install it. <br>
<br>You can either install the "<a href="http://web.mit.edu/macdev/KfM/KerberosClients/KerberosApp/Documentation/using-osx.html">Kerberos Extras</a>", and and get a ticket for "yourusername@FNAL.GOV", or just do it from the command line in a terminal window:<br>
&gt; kinit yourusername@FNAL.GOV&nbsp; <br>
and enter your kerberos password when prompted.<br>
<br>
Once you've got a ticket you can connect to a unix node with:<br>
<br>
&gt; ssh -XKA node.fnal.gov<br>
<br>
Once you're connected, you can test the link by typing<br>
<br>
&gt; xterm<br>
<br>
I've found that sometimes OSX updates will cause problems with XQuartz
and you will be unable to open Xwindows from a remote note.&nbsp;
Relinstalling XQuartz generally fixes the problem.<br>
</div>
<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Linux</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Xwindows is built into linux.&nbsp; The kerberos tools may or may not be there.&nbsp; Try typing <br>
&gt; kinit&nbsp; yourusername@FNAL.GOV<br>
<br>
If it doesn't work, you'll need to install the kerberos utilities for
your system.&nbsp; On Redhat, Fedora, Scientific Linux, etc, you can do<br>
&gt; sudo yum install krb5-workstation krb5-libs krb5-auth-dialog<br>
<br>
On Ubuntu, type<br>
&gt; sudo apt-get install krb5-user<br>
<br>
Download the correct krb5.conf configuration file from <a href="http://computing.fnal.gov/authentication/krb5conf/">here</a>
and copy it to the /etc/ directory on your main hard disk.&nbsp; It's a
good idea to make a backup copy of the previous version. <br>
<br>
Once it's installed, get a ticket with:<br>
&gt; kinit yourusername@FNAL.GOV<br>
<br>
Once you've done that, you can connect to a unix node with<br>
<br>

&gt; ssh -XKA node.fnal.gov<br>
<br>

Once you're connected, you can test the link by typing<br>
<br>

&gt; xterm<br>
</div>
<br>
</div>




<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">MS Windows</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">There are several ways to handle
kerberos/xwindows access under windows, none of them very good.&nbsp;
Ask your supervisor if he or she has a preferred solution.&nbsp;
Otherwise, the simplest solution I found is to use MIT Kerberos for Windows,
PuTTY, and Xming, as described <a href="http://home.fnal.gov/%7Eprebys/misc/AAAreadme/AAA-MS-Windows-X11.html">here</a>.<br>
