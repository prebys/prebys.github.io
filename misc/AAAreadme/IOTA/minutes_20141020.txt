D. Bruhwiler: RadiaSoft efforts
-------------------------------
Preparing for a Phase II proposal in December
Working on inducing wakefield-induced instabilities and demonstrating that they are ameliorated by nonlinear lattice

Phase I: Show feasibility.  Non-linear magnet model implemented in Synergia.  Running test particles and comparing with MADX and LifeTrack.

Phase II: Use simulations and calculations to prepare an experimental run plan

Suggestion from Sasha: increase space charge to show benefit of non-linear lattice.
Action item:  Steven will look into this.

Proposed Phase II tasks:
   - simulate RFQ bunches debunching in the IOTA ring using WARP (or possibly Synergia?)
        comment: concentrate on halo formation, characterization, and losses
   - Will iterate on this over the next months
