<h3>1.&nbsp; Commissioning of ASTA test accelerator</h3>
Mentor: Elvin Harms<br>
Student: Lucas Kang, Brown University<br>
<br>
ASTA beam commissioning. ASTA may be a busy place this summer with
commissioning 20 - 55 MeV electrons, carrying out first experiments and
running SRF systems. Project might include the development of some
applications for beam operation or performing some specific beam
measurement and analyzing the results. <br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
<br>
Physics background and some analytical skills.<br>
Knowledge of analysis software would be good here.<br>
<br>
<h3>2.&nbsp; Testing of Extinction Monitor Components<br>
</h3>

Mentor: Eric Prebys<br>

Student: Logan Rudd, University of California Berkeley<br>
<br>
Study efficiency and other properties of quartz radiators and photomultiplier tubes which will<br>
be used in Mu2e upstream beam extinction monitor.<br>
<br>
Project will involve setting up a cosmic ray muon telescope to measure the efficiency<br>
and after-pulsing characteristics of quartz radiators and photomultiplier tubes that<br>
will be used to measure out of time beam in the Mu2e experiment.&nbsp; Project might<br>
also involve placing detectors in the Main Injector tunnel or other beam enclosures<br>
to study backgrounds.<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
Some familiarity with oscilloscopes and basic electronics<br>
Some programming or scripting experience, preferrably C, C++, or Java<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>3. Mu2e Targeting Studies</h3>
Mentor: Eric Prebys<br>
Student: Takumi Matsuzawa, Kalamazoo College<br>
<br>
Student will use the g4beamline program to carry out studies of
targeting beam at the Mu2e production target, through the solenoidal
field, both in the current configuration and in proposed upgrade
scenarios.<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
Experience in programming and physics simulation and analysis.<br>
<br>

<h3>5. Channeling Experiments in ASTA<br>
</h3>
Mentor: Tanaji Sen<br>


Student: Kyle Capobianco-Hogan, SUNY Stony Brook<br>

<br>
Intern will participate in X-ray channeling radiation experiments at
ASTA, apply corrections for background rejection, detector calibration,
detector deadtime and pileup to extract the X-ray spectrum from the
recorded spectrum. Compare with theory and help improve experimental
setup. <br>
<br>
Requirements: <br>
<br>
Courses in electromagnetism, experimental methods<br>
Working knowledge of at least one of:&nbsp; python/Mathematica/C/Fortran<br>
<br>
<h3>5. Simulations Studies of the Low Energy Injector at ASTA</h3>
<br>
Mentor: Charles Thangaraj/Alexander Valishev<br>
Student: Tianyi Ge, UCLA<br>
<br>
The student will write extensive python code to simulate the low energy
injector at ASTA. The goal of this code is to be able to track, match,
study space-charge effects, study bunch compression and error/jitter
studies on the low energy injector lattice with an emphasis on
practical 'machine studies'. The code should be usable by the machine
operator to conduct quick analytical simulations to check with
experiment. Detailed nature of the limits of experiments has to be
integrated. Laser shaping and other additions will be included as an
option. At the end of this, the student will have a very good
understanding of modern linear accelerators and the physics of low
energy electron beams. <br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
Good analytical skills<br>
Some programming background<br>
<br>
<h3>6. Gas-filled Hadron Monitor for Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF)</h3>

Mentor: Katsuya Yonehara<br>

Student: Holly Dinkel, University of Missouri-Columbia<br>
<br>
The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) is the future flagship
experiment at Fermilab. A hadron flux monitor plays an important role
to measure quality of the secondary charged particles and to precisely
direct the beam to the neutrino detectors located hundreds of
kilometers away. However, the standard hadron monitor based on an
ionization chamber has a limited lifetime.&nbsp; A novel gas-filled
RF-resonator beam profile monitor is proposed.<br>
<br>
It will be simple structure and, therefore radiation-robust in
extremely high radiation environments. Analytical physics model in the
gas-filled RF resonator shows that the permittivity of gas will be
changed by the incident charged particles that is enough sensitivity
with the LBNF beam profile. <br>
<br>
We will design the proof-of-principle test at MTA in Fermilab to verify
the concept of new hadron monitor.&nbsp; Summer student start
estimating the heat deposition of intense MTA beam into the monitor by
using The analytical and numerical calculations. The student will also
participate the present gas-filled RF experiment at the MTA to
understand the physics in the gas-filled RF resonator.<br>

<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
Basic physics knowledge<br>
Analytical skills<br>
Interest in detector technology<br>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Lahsen Assoufid</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Benjamin Sheff, University of California, Berkeley<br>
</span></h3>Contribute to the development of a sub-100 nanoradian angle
calibration device for the Advanced Photon Source (APS) slope measuring
profiler. The measurement device is built using the weak-link structure
technology developed at the Advanced Photon Source for nano-positioning
stages. This work, to be performed in collaboration with the APS Optics
Group metrology staff, involves measurements, data analysis, and
reporting of the result.<br>
<br>Requirements:<br>
<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic math, physics and optics<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ability to conduct experimental work<br>

<h3>2. Stability of Notch Filter for RF Feedback</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Tim Berenc</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Trevor Vannoy, Montana State University</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>
Radio-frequency (rf) systems employ feedback to regulate both the
amplitude and phase of the accelerating voltage in a particle
accelerator. An adaptive notch filter is presently being investigated
for the Advanced Photon Source (APS) storage ring rf systems [1]. This
project will consist of a detailed and thorough stability analysis of
the adaptive notch filter system, including experimental studies. Such
an analysis will also be applicable to rf systems which employ feedback
of a similar form as the adaptive notch filter. This allows analysis of
the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system to be reduced to the
analysis of a single-input single-output (SISO) system.<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
<br>
lectrical engineering student with coursework in feedback control
theory, signal processing (i.e., fast fourier transforms and power
spectral densities), and RF concepts. Background in complex
analysis/number theory is a plus.<br>
Strong motivation and independence in experiment and data analysis.
Experience with MATLAB/Simulink, LabView, and FPGA programming.<br>

<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Nathan Prins, Towson University</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>High-intensity
superconducting radio-frequency proton and heavy-ion accelerators are
being developed for medical, industrial, national-security, and basic
research applications.&nbsp; Experimental and theoretical work is
underway to precisely define the beam- currents, beam-energy, and
operating conditions for the separate application scenarios.&nbsp;
Examples of much of the technology required to build the high-energy
sections (0.4 &#8211; 1 GeV per nucleon) of these accelerators have been
demonstrated and are routinely fabricated.&nbsp; In this project you
will help with the fabrication and assembly of a new half-wave
resonator cryomodule for the Fermilab PIP-II project, a high intensity
H- accelerator.&nbsp; You will be exposed to many aspects of
experimental physics and mechanical engineering in this project:
handling of radio-frequency superconducting devices, precision
machining and manufacturing, high-vacuum systems, low-particulate
cleaning and clean-room technology, magnetic shielding, and thermal
transport.<br>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Richard Farnsworth</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Jialun Luo, Carleton College<br>
</span></h3>This project involves the development and testing of data aquisition code for an envelope detector module. The test
script will allow the user to scan data from the detector's eight
channels one by one. The&nbsp; script will gather, linearize and save
the data from the detector in an organized file. An existing python
based software suite called PyEpics will be used to control and access
the channels of the detector. The software developer will become to be
familiar with Python as well as with the EPICS software suite. <br>
