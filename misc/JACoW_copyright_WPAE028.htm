<h3 align="center">PART B -- U.S. GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE CERTIFICATION</h3>
Authors who are U.S. Government employees are not required to sign Part A of
the IEEE Copyright Form, but any coauthors outside the U.S. Government are
required to sign Part A (see JOINT AUTHORSHIP above).  Authors whose work
was performed under a U.S. Government contract or grant, but who are not
Government employees, are required to sign Part A of this form.
(Note:  If your work was performed under U.S. Government contract but you
are not a U.S. Government employee, sign Part A of this form and see item 4).
<p>
This will certify that all authors of the above work are employees of the U.S.

<h3>IEEE POLICY</h3>
<font size="-1">
In connection with its publishing activities, it is the formal policy of the
IEEE to own the copyrights to all copyrightable material in its technical
publications and to the individual contributions contained therein, in order
to protect the interests of the IEEE, its authors and their employers, and, at
the same time, to facilitate the appropriate reuse of this material by
others.  The IEEE distributes its technical publications throughout the world
and does so by various means such as hard copy, microfiche, microfilm, and
electronic media.  It also abstracts and may translate its publications, and
articles contained therein, for inclusion in various compendiums and similar
publications, etc.  When an article is submitted  to the IEEE for publication,
the IEEE understands that its acceptance of the article implies that IEEE has
the rights to do all of the things it normally does with such an article.
</font><p>
<font size="-1">IEEE Policy 6.17 -- CLEARANCE OF PAPERS -- applies to all material submitted
to IEEE:  "The IEEE must of necessity assume that material presented at its
meetings or submitted to its publications is properly available for general
dissemination to the audiences these activities are organized to serve.  It is
the responsibility of the authors, not the IEEE, to determine whether
disclosure of their material requires the prior consent of other parties and,
if so, to obtain it."
</font></p><p>
<font size="-1">Furthermore, the IEEE must assume, if an author uses within his/her article
material that has been previously published and/or is copyrighted by another party,
that permission has been obtained for such use and that any required credit lines,
copyright notices, etc., are duly noted.
</font>
</p><h3>IEEE OBLIGATIONS</h3>
<font size="-1">
In exercising its rights under copyright, the IEEE will make all reasonable
efforts to act in the interests of the authors and employers as well as in its
own interest.  In handling third-party  reprint/republication requests for an
IEEE work, the IEEE requires that 1) the consent of the first-named author be
sought as a condition in granting republication (of a full paper) to others;
and 2) the consent of the employer be obtained as a condition in granting
permission to others to reuse all or portions of a paper for promotion or
marketing purposes.
</font>
<h3>AUTHOR/COMPANY RIGHTS</h3>
<font size="-1">
If you are employed and you prepared your paper as a part of your job, the
rights to your work rest initially  with your employer.  In that case, when
you sign the copyright transfer form, we assume you are authorized to do so by
your employer and that your employer has consented to all the terms and
conditions of this form.  If not, it should be signed by someone so
authorized. (See also Policy 6.17 above.)
</font><p>
<font size="-1">SPECIAL NOTE TO EMPLOYERS: Just as the IEEE requires a signed copyright
transfer form (for copyrightable material) in order to do "business as usual,"
it is the intent of the transfer portion of the form to return rights to the
author and employer so that they, too, may do "business as usual."
