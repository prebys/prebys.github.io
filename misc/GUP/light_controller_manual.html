This document is meant as a simple guide to familiarize users with the
Chauvet StageDesigner 50 DMX light controller as it&#8217;s configured for
the Geneva Underground Playhouse. It's not meant to replace the manual,
and doesn't include initial setup instructions or other information not
relevant to use in the theater.&nbsp; It's meant for those who will be
programming the board, as well as those who will be using the board
after it has been programmed by someone else.&nbsp; The full manual can be found <a href="Stage_Designer_50_UM_Rev08.pdf">here</a>.<br>
<br>
All users are encouraged to carefully read the <a href="#Startup">Startup</a>, <a href="#Shutdown">Shutdown</a>, and <a href="#Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> sections before using the board.<br>

<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The light controller is set up to control up to 12 lights, via two DMX
6-channel dimmer packs.&nbsp; Channels 1-6 are in the pack on Stage
Right , and
channels 7-12 are in the pack on Stage Left.&nbsp; The actual mapping
of the lights to the channels often changes from show to show, although
channel 12 will always control the house lights.<br>
<br>
In general, there are two modes of operation for the board:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Direct (&#8220;12 Channel A/B&#8221;) Mode &#8211; This is the simple,
non-programmed mode, in which the sliders control the lights
directly.&nbsp; Sliders 1-12 (top) form bank A, while sliders 13-24
(bottom) form bank B and control the same lights.&nbsp; Each bank is
controlled by its own master fader.&nbsp; Thus, while a scene is
displayed from one bank, the next scene can be set up in the other bank.</li>
  <li>Programmed
(&#8220;Chase&lt;-&gt;Scene&#8221;) Mode &#8211; In this mode, complete sets of
light levels are stored as &#8220;steps&#8221;, then one or more steps are stored
together as a "scene". Each scene is then assigned to one of the
sliders
in the bottom bank, with the overall level set by master fader B.
Scenes with a single step are referred to as "static" scenes.
Multi-step scenes can play out in a timed sequence, stepped thropugh
manually, or synchronized
to music.&nbsp; <br>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Startup"></a>Startup</h2>
There's no power switch on the board.&nbsp; It's usually left plugged
into the power strip and comes on along with everything else when the
power strip is turned on.&nbsp; It always comes up in &#8220;blackout&#8221; mode,
indicated by the green LED above the &#8220;blackout&#8221; button.&nbsp; Push the
"blackout" button to make the LED go out.<br>
<br>
When the board is first powered up and brought out of blackout, the
lights will still be out, regardless of the position of the sliders. A
level or scene will not be activated until the associated slider is
moved.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, it's generally best to start with all the sliders at "0".<br>
<h2>Shutdown</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Powering down the light board does not shut the lights off!</span>In
fact, it might send the lights to full on and trip the breakers. Set
all sliders to "0", hit the BLACKOUT button, and then power down the
board, either by uplugging the power strip or turning it off.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT:&nbsp; Even if the lights are blacked out, there's a glitch
that occasionally causes one or more of them to turn on when the board
is powered down.&nbsp; If this happens, power the board up, toggle the&nbsp; BLACKOUT button off and on, and shut it down again.<br>
<br>
Our lights are very old and get very hot.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Never, under any
circumstances, leave stage lights on when the theater is
unattended.</span>&nbsp; If all else fails, the lights can be shut off at the
breaker panel in the HVAC closet at the opposite corner from the tech
booth.&nbsp; The two breakers which control the dimmer packs are marked
with blue tape.<br>
&#8195;<br>
<h2>Non-Programmed (1-12 A/B) Operation</h2>
The board can be operated in direct, non-programmed mode even if it's
been programmed for a different application.&nbsp; To set up for
non-programmed operation:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Verify that the BLACKOUT LED is not lit.&nbsp; If it is, tap the "BLACKOUT" button until it's extinquished.</li>
  <li>Use the "MODE" button to set the MODE to "(1-12 A/B)" (yellow LED) mode.</li>
</ol>
Generally, you will want to set the "FADE" speed to INSTANT (UP), or
some very short value, and control the speed with the individual
sliders or master faders.&nbsp; Setting the FADE speed too slow is a
common way of convincing yourself the board isn't working.<br>
<br>
In this mode, the A bank (1-12, top) and the B bank (13-24, bottom)
each control channels 1 through 12.&nbsp; The overall ampltude is set
by the A and B master faders just to the right of the banks.&nbsp; In
general, while a scene is displayed from one bank, the fader for the
other bank is set to zero, so the next scene can be set up.&nbsp; The A
fader has the maximum up and the B has the maximum down to simplify
cross-fading from one scent to the next, although both are independent,
so any combination of the A and B banks can be displayed.<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="Programming"></a>Programming</h2>
Each set of light levels can be saved as a separate "scene" or as
individual "steps" within a scene.&nbsp; In "Mix&lt;-&gt;Chase"
playback mode, each scene is assigned to one of the 12 sliders in the
"B" (bottom) bank, with the "B" master fader controller the overall
intensity.&nbsp; The steps within a scene can play out in a timed
sequence, can be synchronized with music, or can be stepped through
manually.&nbsp; Scenes that contain only a single step are referred to
as "static" scenes.<br>
<br>
Since there are 12 sliders in the bank, up to 12 scenes can be
controlled at a time.&nbsp; These can be selected from 4 pages, for a total of 48 scenes in memory.&nbsp; Each scene
can have up to 1000 steps, for a total of 48000 individual lighting
states.<br>
<br>
Lighting transitions in a show can be done either by switching from one
static scene to another or by stepping through multiple steps withing a
scene or scenes. The choice is up to the light designer programming the
board, but in most cases it's easier to do it as a series of static
scenes.&nbsp; Cases where multi-step scenes are appropriate include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Shows or parts of a show with a very large number of different
lighting configurations, such that having 12 scenes available at a time
is not enough.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Instances with rapid and/or automated lighting sequences.</li>
</ul>
It's worth remembering that the "A" (top) bank continues to control
individual lights.&nbsp; Among other things, this can be used to
"sneak" individual lights in and out of a scene. In some cases, this
could be an alternative to complex programming sequences.<br>
<br>
The general procedure for programming is to record a step or sequencial
series of steps to temporary memory and then assign them to a
particular page and scene number.&nbsp; The procedure is the same
for all of the different playback modes.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="Programming_Steps_and_Scenes_"></a>Programming Steps and Scenes<br>
</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Use the "MODE" button to set the mode to "1-24A" (green LED).</li>
  <li>Set the "FADE" slider to "INSTANT" (UP).<br>
  </li>
  <li>To
put the board into RECORD mode, while holding the
"RECORD"button, tap "flash" buttons (buttons under the sliders) 1,
5,6, and 8 in order, then release the "RECORD" button.&nbsp; All the
blue leds
above the sliders should FLASH once, indicating the board is in record
mode.</li>
  <li>To program a step into local memory, set the sliders to their
desired configuration and then tap the "RECORD"
button. All the blue LEDs should FLASH and the display should indicate "STEP 1". </li>
  <li>If there are multiple steps in the scene, repeat (3) until they
have all been loaded.&nbsp; The step count on the display should
increment each time.</li>
  <li>Use the "PAGE" button to select the page (1 to 4) where you want to store the scene.</li>
  <li>While
holding the "RECORD" button, tap the "FLASH" button below
the slider for which you want to load the scene.&nbsp;All blue LEDs should flash, indicating the scene has been loaded. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Loading the scene clears the local memory and resets the step counter to zero in preparation for
programming the next scene.&nbsp; If you make a mistake, you can
manually clear the local memory by holding the "RECORD" button and tapping "PAGE/REC CLR".</li>
  <li>Repeat (4 through 8) for any additional scenes.</li>
  <li>Exit RECORD mode by holding the "RECORD" button and tapping "REC EXIT".</li>
</ol>
Note that temporary memory is erased when you exit record mode or power
down the board.&nbsp; Scenes remain stored until they are erased or
replaced.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="Editing_Steps"></a>Editing Steps</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Use "MODE" button to set the mode to "Chase&lt;-&gt;Scene" (red LED). Yes, this is different than when recording scenes!</li>
  <li>Set master fader B to max, so you can see the effect of your edits!<br>
  </li>
  <li>To
put the board into RECORD mode, while holding the
"RECORD"button, tap "flash" buttons (buttons under the sliders) 1,
5,6, and 8 in order, then release the "RECORD" button.&nbsp; All the
blue leds
above the sliders should FLASH once, indicating the board is in record
mode.</li>
  <li>While holding the "EDIT" buttons, tap the FLASH button for the
scene you wish to edit.&nbsp; The yellow LED above the scene should
come on and the display should read "EDITING".&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Set the scene's slider to max so you can see the effect of the edits on the scene.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If necessary, press "STEP" to select the step within the scene which you wish to edit.</li>
  <li>To raise (lower) a level hold the UP (DOWN) button, then press
and hold the FLASH button of the channel you wish to change.&nbsp; The
display will show the changing level (0-254) of the light
setting.&nbsp; Hold both buttons until the desired level is reached,
then release.</li>
  <li>Repeat (7) for any other levels in the step.</li>
  <li>Repeat (4) through (8) for any other scenes and steps you wish to edit.</li>
  <li>Exit EDIT mode by holding the "RECORD" button and tapping "REC EXIT".</li>
  <li>Exit RECORD mode by holding the "RECORD" button and tapping "REC EXIT" a second time.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<br>
<h2>Pre-programmed Operation<br>
</h2>
To set up the board for programmed playback:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Press the "MODE" button to put the board in "Chase&lt;-&gt;Scene" (red LED) mode.</li>
  <li>Press the "PARK" button to put the board in "Mix Chase" (yellow
LED) mode.&nbsp; This will allow different scenes to be mixed and to
allow one to cross-fade one scene to another.</li>
</ol>
Now each of the bank B (lower) 12 sliders controls a scene, programmed
as in the previous section.&nbsp; There are four pages of scenes,
selected with the "PAGE" button and indicated by the LEDs below.&nbsp;
A scene starts when its slider is moved to a non-zero value or when its
FLASH button is tapped or held.&nbsp; You can cross-fade from one scene
to another by simultaneously lowering one scene's slider and raising
the other.&nbsp; If you switch pages while a scene is playing, that
scene will continue to play, rather than switching immediately to the
scene stored on the new page.&nbsp; In this way, you can cross-face
scenes between pages <span style="font-style: italic;">unless they have the same scene number</span>.&nbsp;
To switch to a scene with the same number on a different page, you
would have to switch pages and lower the slider to 0 (in either
order).&nbsp; Raising the slider again will load the new scene.<br>
<br>
If a scene has multiple steps, there are several ways to step through
them.&nbsp; In all cases, the steps will continue to cycle through the
programmed sequence indefinitely; that is, they will not step when they
get to the last step.<br>
<br>
Also for all cases, the FADE speed slider will control how fast one
step transitions to the next.&nbsp; Most of the range of the slider is
beyond the range that would normally be used.&nbsp; Setting the FADE
too slow might give you the impression the board is not working.<br>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Manually</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If the green AUDIO LED is lit, tap the "AUDIO" button to extinguish it</li>
    <li>Slide
the SPEED lever to "SHOW MODE" (down).&nbsp; The LED above the STEP
button should not be flashing.&nbsp; If it is, slide the SPEED lever up
and back down to extinguish it.</li>
    <li>Use the STEP button to step through the sequence.&nbsp; The
current step number will show on the display. NOTE: if you step past
the desired step, there is no way to go back.&nbsp; You will need to
either cycle through or start the scene over!!</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Standard beat<br>
  </li>
</ul>
