<h1>2013 <a href="http://www.illinoisacceleratorinstitute.org/">Lee Teng Internship</a> Closeout Notes<br>
</h1>

  

<h2>Background Material</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://home.fnal.gov/%7Eprebys/misc/leeteng2013/">Summary of this year's program,</a> including students, mentors, schedule, presentations and papers.</li>
  <li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/LeeTeng2013EvalResults">Students' evaluations</a> of the program.</li>
  <li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/LeeTeng2013MentorEvalResults">Mentors' evaluations</a> of the program.<br>
  </li>

</ul>
<h2>Advertising/Recruiting</h2>Generally happy with the number and
quality of the applicants, but need to focus a bit on underrepresented
areas like engineering/<br>
<h2>Application Process</h2>
As usual, several students had problems with the application
link.&nbsp; Next year, I will request a "test link" that will record a
response and send it back to the student, just to test the connection.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">We accidentally rejected everyone who applied.</span>
We
only found out about it because we had sent an early acceptance to
Kelsey, or the fallout could have been much worse. Obviously, this can
never happen again. Will work with Ed. Dept. to develop a QC step to
prevent it in the future. <br>
<h2>Projects/Mentors</h2>
Generally, things went pretty well this year. It looks like everyone
was gainfully employed.&nbsp; See evaluations from mentors and students
for specific comments.&nbsp; Want to do more to encourage mentors to
attend talks.<br>
<br>
<h2>Group Activities</h2>Visits went well, and the students really like
them.&nbsp; Some suggested more tours, but we really can't afford the
time.&nbsp; Will include an "Introduction to Accelerator Physics" talk
during the Fermilab visit next year.<br>
<br>
<h2>Action Items</h2>
<h4>Now</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Eric: Send evaluations to mentors (done)</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Before next application period</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Curt: figure out how to better advertise to engineers</li>
  <li>Eric: Talk to Education department about making the online application procedure more robust.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
During next internship</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Eric: Add "Introduction to Accelerator Physics" talk to first Fermilab visit.</li>
  <li>All: Encourage mentors (and others) to attend student talks.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
