<h3>1.&nbsp; Evaluation of Total Loss Monitors for Cryomodule Radiation Measurement<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Elvin Harms, AD</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Yezhezi "Michelle" Zhang, Smith College</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ASTA's
primary components are a normal-conducting photoinjector gun, laser for
producing ultraviolet light which shines on a cathode in order to
produce electrons, superconducting RF systems for accelerating the beam
up to ~250 MeV, and a beam transport line containing instrumentation to
measure and monitor the electron beam qualities. Making beam
measurements and doing off-line analysis to determine values, bringing
superconducting RF systems into operation and characterizing cavity
performance, developing software tools to automate these measurements,
and beam line modeling are some of the activities envisioned to
participate in.<br>

<h3>2. Study of Spherical Array Target for Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment<br>
</h3>
<big>Mentor(s): Alberto Marchionni, AD<br>
Student: Quynh Nguyen, Univesity of Minnesota<br>
<br>Will use simulation code to model target and other beam devices in
the NuMI and or LBNE lines.&nbsp; May also be able to participate in
beam studies and/or magnetic field mapping of the NuMI horn.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></big><h3>3.&nbsp; Simulation of Parametric X-Ray Radiation</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; </big><big>Tanaji Sen, APC</big><br>
<big>Student: Todd Seiss, Princeton University<br>
<br>The goal is to develop bright, monochromatic and tunable sources of
X-rays that can be used for imaging purposes. Two mechanisms are under
study: channeling radiation and parametric X-ray emission (PXR). The
student will work on modeling the expected photon yield of PXR taking
into account details of the crystal structure and geometry, electron
beam energy spread and divergence, scattering processes in the crystal,
detector resolution etc. There will also be the opportunity to
participate in the channeling radiation experiments and connect the
channeling radiation model with the experimental data. The student
should have had at least one undergraduate course in electrodynamics
and preferably one in condensed matter physics. Proficiency in
Mathematica or another programming language such as one of C, C++,
Fortran, Python,&#8230; would be helpful.<br>
<br>
</big><h3>4. Bunch Compression and Emittance Growth Minimization at the Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator</h3><big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Charles Thangaraj, APC</big><br>
<big>
Student: William Wortley, University of Rochester<br>
<br>The student should be comfortable handling sophomore level
(college) maths and will write extensive code to run and analyze the
simulation data. If time permits, the student will make some
measurement along with the supervisor from the accelerator and the
compare experimental data with simulated values. At the end of this
project, the student will gain a good introduction to electron
accelerators, accelerator sub-systems and more specifically to the
bunch compressor which shortens the pulse length of an electron beam.<br>
</big><h3>5. Dielectric sample testing for ceramic insert in high-pressured cavity</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Katsuya Yonehara, APC</big><br>
<big>
Student: Huy Phan, McDaniel College<br>
<br>A ceramic loaded RF cavity is attractive since it can be smaller
volume than the conventional pillbox cavity. An electron cascade is
processed on the surface of loaded ceramic in high RF gradient. As a
result, it induces the RF breakdown at lower RF gradient than the dielectric strength of
ceramics. We propose to fill a buffer gas&nbsp; in the cavity to
terminate the electron cascade. We will measure the RF signal and the
breakdown light.&nbsp; Student will join the experiment and make some analysis by using
analysis code (Mathematica, Root, or custom-made written by the
standard computer language). <br>

<h3>1.&nbsp; Characterization of Growth Rate and Interfacial Roughness of Multilayer Optical X-ray Coatings<br>
<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Lahsen Assoufid</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Yumeng "Melody" Cao, Smith College<br>
</span></h3>The optics
group is building a high resolution angle calibration system for the
new APS long trace profiler. The system is currently being designed in
collaboration with Deming Shu. Some of the key components have already
been procured. We expect to assemble the system beginning of Calendar
Year 2014, develop the control software and perform preliminary tests
by April 2014. The role of the candidate will consist of implementing
and using the calibration tool to calibrate the APS long trace
profiler, analyze the data, determine the performance of the system,
and report the results. If necessary, the candidate is also asked to
determine possible ways to further improve it. This work requires basic
knowledge of optics, good experimental and programming skills, and
knowledge of math and physics.<br>
<br>The work requires knowledge of basic optics, advanced algebra and geometry, and programing in FORTRAN, IDL or Matlab.
<h3>2.&nbsp; RF Noise Suppression for the APS Storage Ring</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Tim Berenc</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Kevin Cook, Giorgia Institute of Technology</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>
Amplitude and phase
noise in the Advanced Photon Source (APS) Storage Ring radio-frequency
(RF) system has a direct impact on electron beam quality. A large
source of noise in the RF system is caused by 60Hz power line harmonic
related noise in the 1MW klystrons which drive the accelerating
cavities. Presently, conventional proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) control is employed in the amplitude and phase control loops.
Applying adaptive noise cancelling techniques to the existing RF system
has shown improved performance. This project will entail experimental
and theoretical development of an adaptive noise cancelling system for
the Storage Ring RF systems.<br>
<br>
Electrical engineering student with coursework in signal processing
(i.e., fast fourier transforms and power spectral densities) and RF
concepts.&nbsp; Strong motivation and independence in experiment and
data analysis. Experience with MATLAB/Simulink.<br>

<h3>3.&nbsp; Progress in the Design and Simulation of a 1 GeV Superconducting Proton Linac for a Nuclear Waste Transmutation ADS<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Brahim Mustapha</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Arjun Kar, Carnegie Mellon University</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>We have recently
developed a preliminary linear accelerator (linac) for an accelerator
driven system (ADS) for the transmutation of nuclear waste produced by
reactors.&nbsp; The prospective student will contribute to the
finalization of the design which should be a good learning experience
for him or her.&nbsp; The work will involve the final design
optimization of RF cavities, the linac lattice design and finishing
with beam dynamics simulations of the linac for different beam currents.<br>

<h3>4. XMAT linac design and simulations<br>
</h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Jerry A. Nolen</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Brandon Rayhaun, University of Chicago</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br>We are designing a linear
accelerator (linac) for a new Extreme Material (XMAT) facility at
Argonne. The facility is for material irradiation using ion beams
produced by the linac. The defects to the irradiated materials will be
studied using photons from the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne.
This project focuses on the design and simulations of the linac
including a Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and several room
temperature cavities. Following the linac lattice design, consisting of
the optimization of focusing and accelerating forces, end-to-end beam
dynamics simulations will be performed for different ion beams. The
beam spot must be very small at the final image and a magnetic
de-magnifying stage is to be designed using either superconducting
solenoids or quadrupole magnets.<br>
</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">This effort is ongoing and the
interested student should be able to contribute to any part of the
work, which should be a great learning experience and a good
introduction to accelerator physics.<br>

Student: Li-Chia Tai, UCLA<br>
<br>The Lee Teng summer project will consist of the development of an
automated, software-controlled data acquisition system for the
evaluation and testing of traveling wave rf structures. Labview will
primarily be utilized to acquire data and to post-process results and
will be further developed to facilitate the ease and accuracy of
testing.&nbsp; Various methods, including the nodal shift and bead pull
methods, will be evaluated and implemented in Labview for the analysis
and tuning of the rf structures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
