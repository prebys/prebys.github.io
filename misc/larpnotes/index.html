<h1>Notes for Giorgio (confidential)<br>
</h1>
<h2>Budget</h2>
<h3>Generating the Budget</h3>
Producing the annual budget is arguably the most important part of the
job.&nbsp; The procedure will probably change as LARP becomes
projectized, but this is how we've done it up until now:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Of the $12.4M total budget, we try to initially assign about $10M
to the labs, with the rest in DOE-held contingency.&nbsp; Historically,
this has been divided as follows</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Accelerator Systems: $3M</li>
    <li>Magnet Systems: $5M</li>
    <li>Programmatic Activities: $2M</li>
  </ul>
  <li>We start the budget creation in July, and it's different for each sub-task</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Accelerator Systems: Tom sends a call for budget requests from the various tasks, as well as any proposed new activities.</li>
    <li>Magnet Systems:&nbsp; Since the magnet program is monolithic, the magnet group generates a budget based on the above guidance</li>
    <li>Programmatic Activies: I've generated this based on the
management spreadsheet, Toohig and LTV counts, and historical travel
useage.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>We meet several times to whittle this budget into shape.&nbsp; I use the buget table provided by Ron Prwivo (see <a href="#tracking">below</a>) as a worksheet, but I submit it to the DOE rolled up to level 2 (all they
actually care about is the lab totals).&nbsp; They normally want it by
August 1.&nbsp; I send DOE the budget table along with a short
narrative about the process and priorities.&nbsp; Here is an example.&nbsp; This is sent to <a href="Bruce.Strauss@science.doe.gov">Bruce Strauss</a> and <a href="Michael.Procario@science.doe.gov">Mike Procario</a>.&nbsp; Ask for a confirmation.<br>
  </li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="tracking"></a>Budget Tracking</h3>
I kept the system implemented by Peggs, in which the master budget tracking is done by <a href="mailto:prwivo@bnl.gov">Ron Prwivo</a>
at BNL.&nbsp; He's given the budget and then the labs submit monthly
reports to him, which he turns around into the master tracking report,
which he uploads <a href="https://plone.uslarp.org/PM/Administration/Financials/">here</a>.&nbsp; I initially wanted to change things, but this always worked pretty well.<br>
<h3>Contingency Release</h3>We have traditionally kept about $2M in
DOE-held contingency.&nbsp; We
release this in a FIN plan, or series of FIN plans throughout the
year.&nbsp; We generally have tried to release the bulk of it in the
April FIN plan, but leave a bit to cover late year shortfalls.&nbsp;
The&nbsp; DOE needs the FIN plan in the first week of the month before
you need it.&nbsp; I've normally met with the same group that puts the
budget together to identify contingnency needs.&nbsp; I submit a report
to the DOE similar to the one I use for the initial budget
request.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h3>Carry Forward</h3>
Traditionally, the LARP accounts at the labs get much less scrutiny
than other accounts, so there isn't this "use it or lose it" attitute
that you see elsewhere.&nbsp; We've typically ended each year with
pretty health carry forwards, and in fact that's what's getting us
through the sequestration this year.<br>
<br>
The DOE will tell you you can carry forward any remaining contingency, but <span style="font-style: italic;">this is a lie</span>.&nbsp; Make sure to request all the contingency before the end of the fiscal year or you will lost it!<br>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
The DOE makes lots of mistakes.&nbsp; There have been major errors in
the initial budget guidance, FIN plan releases, and most recently with
the partial releases for the continuing resolution.&nbsp; When asked
why these occurred, we were invariably blamed - all email trails to the
contrary notwithstanding.&nbsp; Keep an eye on things.<br>
<h2>Meetings, meetings</h2>
<h3>Collaboration Meeting</h3>
As you know, the two annual meetings have been
replaced by two joint meetings with the HL-LHC project.&nbsp; The fall
meeting is in Europe and primarily organized by them, while the spring
meeting is in the US.&nbsp; While these are "joint" meetings, the US
meeting tends to be primarily LARP with some HL-LHC content, while the
European one is the comlement.<br>
<br>
For the US meeting, we've traditionally followed a rotation through <span style="font-style: italic;">regions</span>,
with the West Coast alternating between SLAC and LBNL when their turn
comes. By this rotation, the next US spring collaboration meetings
should be: BNL(2014), FNAL(2015), SLAC(2016).&nbsp; Note that in this
scheme, BNL and FNAL end up hosting twice as often as SLAC or LBNL, so
you might consider changing it.&nbsp; The lab hosting the meeting
generally takes the lead in the practical details (rooms, badges,
dinner, etc), but it will always be your job to take the lead in
setting up the agenda. You can see the agendas of previous meetings at
the <a href="http://www.uslarp.org/">website</a>. Peggs always liked
lots of parallel sessions, while I've prefered to try to get as many
people in one room as possible.&nbsp; I usually start discussing the
agenda with the key LARP people and people from CERN (Lucio Rossi,
Oliver Bruning, and possibly Ezio Todesco) starting about two months
ahead of time.<br>
<br>
Margie has been handling the practical details of the meeting at FNAL, but maybe you'll want to use someone in TD.<br>
<br>
The European meeting is organized by the HL-LHC people, but it's
important for us to push for LARP content, as we tend to be
marginalized unless we speak up.&nbsp; I've usually called a meeting of
key LARP people to figure out what we want to have included, then
arrange a meeting with Lucio and Oliver. Once the agenda is set, you'll
have no responsibilities for the European meeting, which is quite a
relief.<br>
<h3>Chamonix and LARP/CERN Meeting</h3>
The annual LHC Performance workshop at Chamonix is the most important
meeting for keeping yourself involved and up to date with activities at
the LHC.&nbsp; It takes place in late January and is by invitation
only.&nbsp; We've usually lobbied and gotten invitations for myself,
Tom, and GianLuca.&nbsp; You'll want to remind Oliver that you'll be
taking my place.&nbsp; You'll get invitations for the whole week, but
the first three days are extremely detailed and technical so I've
usually gone for the last two days, which are the strategy and planning
sessions.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I like to schedule an annual meeting with the CERN brass right after
Chamonix to discuss our impressions of Chamonix and plans for the
future.&nbsp; It would be nice to do it immediately the following
Monday, but unfortunately they usually schedule the LHC MAC at the
beginning of that week, so it ends up being later.&nbsp; We've played
with the format of this meeting and found that it's most effective to
keep it small, focused and <span style="font-style: italic;">short</span>.
I normally schedule it for two hours, but assume the big shots will
only be there for the first hour, while other people might hang around
for informal discussions afterwards.&nbsp; <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=126247">Here's</a>
and example of the agenda.&nbsp; We give a very brief status update,
our impression of what we heard Chamonix, and then a bunch of
discussion questions.&nbsp; Among other things, this is a great time to
ask the CERN people for the <span style="font-style: italic;">letters</span>
that the DOE likes so much.&nbsp; They will usually ask you for an
"example" of what you want - by which they mean you write it and they
will put it on CERN sign it.<br>
<br>
Note that there probably won't be a Chamonix in 2014 because the LHC is
down, but it's probably still good to schedule the US CERN meeting.<br>
<br>
The invitation list for the meeting should be at least Heuer, Myers,
Lucio, Oliver, Ezio, Jean-Pierre Koutchouk, and a few other people you
can decide on.&nbsp; Because these people are really busy, you'll need
to start scheduling it at least two to three months in advance.&nbsp;
Even so, don't be offended if Rolf gets called away to entertain some
visiting head of state or news crew.<br>
<h3>DOE Briefing</h3>
The DOE likes an annual briefing, and I've found it's best to schedule
it shortly after Chamonix.&nbsp; In the past, Tom, GianLuca and I have
gone and invited Bruce Strauss, LK Len, Mike Procario, and Jim
Siegrist.&nbsp; We schedule about two hours, show the same slides we
showed at the LARP/CERN meeting, but fill in some responses from the
discussion questions.&nbsp; We also raise any important questions we
might have for them.<br>
<br>
Of course, you can schedule an ad hoc briefing with the DOE any time
you have something important to discuss with them, and it is generally
a good idea to do so.&nbsp; They like to hear from us and more
importantly, as far as I can tell, they <span style="font-style: italic;">don't actually talk to one another</span> when we're not around.<br>
<h3>Annual DOE Review</h3>
The DOE demands an annual review of the program.&nbsp; Bruce will start
bugging you early in the year about setting a date, but it's usually in
July.&nbsp; The DOE will pick the reviewers and write the charge, but
the agenda is your responsibility.&nbsp; Here's an example.&nbsp; We
usually have a day of presentations, and then do question and answers
in the morning of the following day with the closeout in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
Between you and me, I've always found this review to be of limited use.
First of all, the DOE picks the reviewers and there's a pretty big
turnover, so you'll get completely contradictory (and sometimes just
plain stupid) recommendations from year to year.&nbsp; Second, they've
usually been horrible about getting a written report out.&nbsp; It's
almost never come out before the new year.&nbsp; Of course, there are
the closeout slides, but the problem is that the head of OHEP doesn't
read anything until the report comes out, so you may find yourself
answering for for that have long since been solved.&nbsp; Note, they
did a lot better at the last review.<br>
<br>
Obviously, this review isn't going to go away, but my advice is to try
to collaborate with Bruce about choosing reviewers, and keep pushing to
get the report back in a timely manner.<br>
<h3>Other Meetings</h3>
When I took over LARP, there were a whole lot of committees and
meetings, but I didn't find them all that useful and they've gradually
gone away.&nbsp; The ones above are the only regular meetings that
remain.&nbsp; In addition, there are numberous ad hoc meetings arranged
as needed for things like the annual budget, contingency release, and
of course organizing the meetings above.<br>
<br>
As LARP evolves into a full-blown project, you will probably have more regular meetings, including monthly PMGs.<br>
<br>
<h2>Website, Mailing Lists, etc</h2>
<h3>Websites</h3>
The main <a href="http://www.uslarp.org/">LARP website</a> is maintained at <br>
//afs/fnal.gov/files/expwww/uslarp/html<br>
I think you'll have to submit a helpdesk ticket to get read/write
access.&nbsp; It was created by Alan Wehman using DreamWeaver, but
since then I've maintained it by just making simple edits with <a href="http://kompozer.net/">Kompozer</a>.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I generally set up a page for PAC and IPAC meetings to list LARP
contributions.&nbsp; I'm happy to keep doing this if you'd like.
Otherwise, you can look in one of the meetings/pac directories to see
how it's formatted.<br>
<br>
We used to set up collaboration meeting and review pages here, but now
we just use Indico for everything.&nbsp; LARP meetings are listed on
the Fermilab Indico server under <a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/categoryDisplay.py?categId=157">"Divisions/Sections/Centers-&gt;LARP-&gt;Workshops &amp; Meetings"</a>.&nbsp; If you don't have permission to create meetings here, Tom Markiewicz appears to be the administrator.<br>
<br>
We have a <a href="http://larpdocs.fnal.gov/">LARP document database</a>
(if you don't know the uname/pw, I'll send it to you separately), but I
haven't been very good about enforcing its use.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:giorgioa@fnal.gov">Giorgio Ambrosio</a> is an administrator.<br>
<br>
We also have a <a href="https://plone.uslarp.org/">plone site</a>, which is used extensively by the magnet people and is also where Ron has been putting the <a href="https://plone.uslarp.org/PM/Administration/Financials/">financials</a>
every month.&nbsp; It used to be the main LARP page, so it's got a lot
of extermely outdated stuff on it as well (in spite of numerous
requests to clean it up). Elliott Mccrory is the administrator, or at
least one of them.<br>
<br>
For reasons I've never understood, the <a href="http://www.interactions.org/toohig/index.html">Toohig Felllowship webpage</a> was created at <a href="http://www.interactions.org/cms/">interactions.org</a>.&nbsp;
We talked about moving it to our page, but we really don't change it
very often, so we've just sent them requested changes.&nbsp; The last
person we communicated with was a guy named Kevin Munday (<a href="mailto:munday@xenomedia.com">munday@xenomedia.com</a>), but that was several years ago.&nbsp; The general contact email is <a href="mailto:webmaster@interactions.org">webmaster@interactions.org</a>. <br>
<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
I've used many mailing lists for LARP, but many are no longer
useful.&nbsp; I've added you as an administrator to the following lists. &nbsp;All lists are @USLARP.ORG<br><ul><li><a href="mailto:larp@uslarp.org">LARP</a> - master LARP mailing list</li><li><a href="mailto:larp_l2@uslarp.org">LARP_L2</a>
- managers down to L2, plus a few others to represent labs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, I don't use this list much, but it will
probably be more useful as the project moves forward. Membership should probably change. </li><li><a href="mailto:larp_cm_organization@uslarp.org">LARP_CM_ORGANIZATION</a>
- This is the list of people to organize collaboration meeting agendas.
&nbsp;The membership of the list will tend to change from one meeting
to the next.</li><li><a href="mailto:LARP_REVIEW@uslarp.org">LARP_REVIEW</a> - Used to organize reviews and communicate with reviewers. &nbsp;Membership tends to change with each review.</li><li><a href="mailto:larp_project@uslarp.org">LARP_PROJECT</a> - The project management list. &nbsp;This could probably completely replace the LARP_L2 list. &nbsp;Your call.</li></ul>
