<h1>Proton Improvement Plan III (PIP-III)</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
PIP-III is currently a generic term used to capture activity related to
proposed activities to increase the high energy (60-120 GeV) proton
power from the Fermilab Main Injector beyond the 1.2 MW goal of <a href="https://pip2.fnal.gov/">PIP-II</a>.
The goal of this effort is to set a performance baseline for long term planning, as
well as to identify open questions which will require R&amp;D resources
to answer in the near term.<br>
<br>
<h2>Reference Specifications</h2>
PIP-II personel have been considering future improvements for some
time, and have reached the tentative conclusion that the most promising
baseline approach to consists of<br>
<ul>
  <li>Replacing the existing Booster with a 20 Hz rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS).&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>Eliminate the Recycler as a preloader, and inject directly into the Main Injector.&nbsp; It
was felt that the aperture restriction of the Recycler represents a
significant design challenge, and the new booster can be designed in
such a way as to eliminate the need or preloading.&nbsp; This choice
also leaves open the option of possibly injecting into the Main
Injector at a higher energy than 8 GeV.</li>
  <li>Setting a target of 2.4 MW at 120 GeV and at least 2 MW at 60 GeV.</li>
</ul>
Reference specications for this machine, as well as alternative scenarios can be found <a href="PIP-2030%20Parameter%20List.xlsx">in this spreadsheet</a>, produced by Valeri Lebedev, Paul Derwent, and Steve Holmes.&nbsp; A summary of the beam requirements can be found in <a href="2030%20Beam%20Requirements.docx">this document</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Main Areas of Research</h2>The key areas of research should focus on the following areas.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Most importantly, is 2.4 MW overly conservative?&nbsp; This
should be determined soon enough to influence design decisions for
LBNF.&nbsp; This of course depends on addressing all the questions
below.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Determining whether the new RCS will be injected directly from
the PIP-II 800 MeV linac, or whether an additional linac will be added
to increase the injection energy to 2 GeV.&nbsp; This decision depends
largely on whether a viable technique can be found to mitigate space
charge tuneshift at injection into the RCS.&nbsp; Promising approaches
include the following, which will both be studied extensively&nbsp; in
the IOTA ring, at the FAST facility:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>integrable non-linear optics</li>
    <li>electron lenses</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Determining the optimum circumference for the RCS.&nbsp;
Estimates so far have assumed that it will have the same circumference
as the existing Booster (1/7th of the Main Injector), but a larger
circumference would reduce the loading time.</li>
  <li>Determining the optimum injection energy for the Main Injector.&nbsp; Current estimates assume it remains at 8 GeV, but raising it could reduce cycle times and possibly mitigate space charge issues.</li>
  <li>Loading, space charge, and electron cloud issues in the Main Injector</li>
</ul>
Once the energy range and key features of the RCS are determined, the more detailed design&nbsp; can continue.<br>
<br>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
Possible alternatives would include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Replacing the RCS with a pulsed linac.&nbsp; This would certainly
be a more expensive and technically complex option, which would only be
justified if there is a physics motivation for a high power 8 GeV
proton beam. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Retaining the Recycler.&nbsp; This would be an option if it
proved impractical to increase the per batch intensity of the new RCS
to compensate for the Main Injector loading time; however, given both
the aperture restrictions of the Recycler and the fact we are designing
the RCS from scratch, this seems like a very unlikely scenario.</li>
</ul>
