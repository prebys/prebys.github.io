<h3>1.&nbsp; Installation and Commissioning of the Radiabeam Profile Monitors at ASTA<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Amber Johnson, John Diamond</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: John Nocita, Kalamazoo College</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">This summer we anticipate the
installation 10 transverse profile monitors in the low energy beamline
at the Advanced Superconducting Test Accelerator (ASTA).&nbsp; An
important diagnostic for the 50 MeV electron beam is optical transition
radiation (OTR) foils and YAG crystal scintillators.&nbsp; Each
Radiabeam station is populated with an OTR foil, either a YAG or LYSO
scintillator, and a target pattern.&nbsp; Once the vacuum portion is
installed, the student will be required to verify proper actuation and
set limit switches on target holders.&nbsp; Software to record images
is currently in development and we will need to confirm functionality
with the 4 different camera models to be installed.&nbsp; Once images
are recorded we will use Matlab to process the data and check that the
resolution requirement of 20 microns is met.<br>

<h3>2. Tomographic Studies of the Longitudinal Phase Space <br>
</h3>
<big>Mentor(s): Duncan Scott<br>
Student: Tegan Johnson, Otterbein University<br>
<br>During the current year long shut-down new software is being
developed to reconstruct the longitudinal phase-space of the Main
Injector and Recycler beam using data acquired from resistive-wall
current monitors. These detectors generate 1-D profiles of the charge
distribution and multiple profiles, taken over many turns around the
machine, can be used with tomography algorithms to reconstruct the
longitudinal phase-space. The profiles can also be analysed to extract
other information, such as single- and coupled-bunch modes of the beam,
beam loading effects, etc. The reconstructions can be used as an online
diagnostic tool and as input for further modelling of the beam. The
code is written in c++ using Fermilab and CERN libraries with a number
of modules on data acquisition, pre-processing raw data, particle
tracking, reconstruction algorithms, data analysis, visualization, a
graphical user interface, etc.<br>
<br>
As this is a new code, still untested with the working accelerator,
there are many opportunities for developing, testing and
benchmarking.&nbsp; A well-motivated student will be able to find many
areas to contribute based on their own preferences. Examples of
possible projects include: <br>
<br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Implementing a filter algorithm during data
pre-processing to account for signal dispersion from the detector. <br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Investigating the effect of the Main Injector beam loading compensation.<br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Using the reconstructions to "measure" beam and
accelerator parameters, such as the beam energy, accelerating voltage,
transition gamma, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Implementing different particle tracking algorithms.<br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Generating an animation of the evolution the longitudinal phase space<br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Linking the outputs of the tomographic reconstruction with other codes to further model the beam <br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;General bug-fixing and testing during accelerator operations and code optimization,<br>
<br>
Experience of c/c++ and/or other programming languages is essential.
Knowledge of accelerator physics is beneficial but not necessary. &nbsp;<br>

</span></big><h3>3. Channeling Radiation at HBESL</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; </big><big>Tanaji Sen, Philippe Piot</big><br>
<big>Student: Christopher Lynn, Swarthmore College<br>
<br>Compact X-ray sources are in great demand for a variety of uses
such as medical imaging, physics research and detection of illicit
materials. The high brightness electron source&nbsp; laboratory (HBESL)
at A0 will use an electron beam from a photoinjector and a diamond
crystal to generate X-rays via channeling radiation. The summer project
will involve theoretical calculation of the expected spectral
distribution of the radiation and comparison with experimental data.
The calculation will be done with a Mathematica code which solves the
relevant one dimensional Schrodinger equation to find the bound state
eigenfunctions and the energy levels. Familiarity with Mathematica,
undergraduate quantum mechanics and electrodynamics is required. <br>
<br>
</big><h3>4.Microwave measurement of e-cloud using resonant cavity technique in MI</h3><big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Charles Thangaraj, Bob Zwaska</big><br>
<big>
Student: Reynier Cruz-Torres, University of Florida<br>
<br>The goal of this experimental work will be to extend the bench
setup on the microwave measurements onto MI measurements. A good goal
will be that the student will be involved in an real experiment&nbsp;
and make phase-shift measurements. He/She will have to do "hands-on
work" and have good grasp of microwave theory and experimental
measurements. <br>
</big><h3>5. Study of surface electric breakdown of ceramic loaded gas-filled RF test cell</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Katsuya Yonehara, Maria Leonova</big><br>
<big>
Student: Yiqing Ding, Purdue University<br>
<br>A ceramic loaded RF cavity is attractive since it can be smaller
volume than the conventional pillbox cavity. An electron cascade is
processed on the surface of loaded ceramic in high RF gradient. As a
result, it induces <br>
the RF breakdown at lower RF gradient than the dielectric strength of
ceramics. We propose to fill a buffer gas&nbsp; in the cavity to
terminate the electron cascade. We will measure the RF signal and the
breakdown light. <br>
Student will join the experiment and make some analysis by using
analysis code (Mathematica, Root, or custom-made written by the
standard computer language). <br>

<h3>1.&nbsp; Computer program to simulate the performance of nanofocusing x-ray mirrors<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Lahsen Assoufid</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Haoyu Sun, University of California, Berkeley</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>Participate in
developing an existing wave optics computer program to simulate the
performance of nanofocusing x-ray mirrors. The code is written in
both&nbsp; IDL and FORTRAN versions. The work includes participating in
the metrology measurements of a focusing x-ray mirror fabricated at the
APS and analysis of the obtained data using the above mentioned
computer code. The goal is to study and quantify the effect of
fabrication error on of the performance of the mirror.<br>
<br>
The work requires knowledge of basic optics, advanced algebra and geometry, and programing in FORTRAN, IDL or Matlab.
<h3>2.&nbsp; Interferometric phase noise measurement system<br>
</h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Tim Berenc</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Pakpoom Buabthong, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>The Short-Pulse X-ray
project at Argonne National Laboratory demands state-of-the-art
differential phase noise tolerances from multiple superconducting
radio-frequency (SRF) cavities.&nbsp; The low-level RF control system
plans on using a calibration tone to suppress cable drift and 1/f noise
of the receiver front end [1].&nbsp; To characterize the benefit of
this process a residual phase noise measurement system needs to have a
sufficiently low noise floor at low frequency offsets from the RF
carrier.&nbsp; This project would entail building a basic form of a RF
interferometric phase noise measurement system [2] based upon our
existing equipment.<br>
<br>
Electrical engineering student with coursework in signal processing
(i.e., fast fourier transforms and power spectral densities) and RF
concepts.&nbsp; Strong motivation and independence in experiment and
data analysis<br>

<h3>3.&nbsp; CARIBU electron beam ion source (EBIS) charge breeder</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Clayton Dickerson</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Kelsey O'Connor, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>
The CARIBU electron beam ion source (EBIS) charge breeder will accept
and trap ion bunches within a magnetically confined electron
beam.&nbsp; The injected ions will reach higher and higher ionization
levels due to electron impact ionization events between the energetic
main electron beam and the electrons bound to the ions.&nbsp; The work
for this project will involve commissioning and testing the EBIS and
its subsystems.&nbsp; Vacuum chambers will be assembled and
aligned.&nbsp; High voltage power supplies will be installed and
connected to the appropriate electrodes.&nbsp; The controls software
will be written to properly monitor and sequence the various
systems.&nbsp; Ultimately the performance of the EBIS will be
benchmarked as the subsystems are installed and brought online.&nbsp;
We are looking for a candidate that can assistance in as many areas as
possible.Accelerator operations, familiarity with vacuum systems,
controls experience, mechanical assembly experience, electronics
experience <br>

<h3>4. Design of RF MgB2 coated cavities<br>
</h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Ali Nassiri, Robert Kustom</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Lauren Perez, Florida International University</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br>The student would participate in
studies on designing RF MgB2 coated cavities that would be compatible
with 10-12K operation using cryocoolers instead of liquid
cryogents.&nbsp; The study would involve calculating RF heat loads
generated in the cavity walls for various cavity shapes and
configurations and integrating the study with thermohydraulic
calculations performed by a cryogenic scientist (probably Yuko
Shiroyanagi). This project is a new LDRD program which is in the early
stages of evolution, and many specifics are not yet decided, however,
an ILC cavity does exist for early testing and would be the starting
point for thermal design and analysis, EM excitation, etc. Other ideas
will undoubtedly develop with further analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></h3>The student should
have a few years of college physics and mathematics with at least an
entry level course on EM theory, and more advanced courses would be
even better. Of course, the student should also be sufficiently
computer literate to learn and apply EM programs with some reasonable
amount of guidance.
<h3>5. Flow-Induced Vibration of X-ray Optics<br>
</h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Curt Preissner, Jeff Collins</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Zichen Xiao, University of Southern California</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">The focus of this project is to
investigate flow-induced vibration of X-ray optics, specifically the
effects of a new type of hose. These Clear Flow Flex turbulence
suppressive low-vibration flexible hoses have a special type of liner
that is designed to reduce the level of vibration caused by the liquid
flowing through the hose. The objectives of the project are to
determine the benefit, if any, from the new hose and gain an
understanding of how the flow conditions cause vibration.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br>
The student will use a laboratory flow measurement system to measure
the level of vibration on a test optic for a variety of hose types and
flow conditions, including a control case. The measurements will be
made with water and with liquid nitrogen if time permits. In the cases
where the fluid is water, the dynamic pressure fluctuations along the
channel wall will be measured.<br>
</span></h3>
The student should have familiarity with: data acquisition systems,
LabView, CAD software (preferably ProE or Solidworks), and ANSYS<br>
It is desirable that the student have experience measuring pressure,
flow, and vibration. This type of experience is typically provided in
an undergraduate experimental engineering methods class.<br>
