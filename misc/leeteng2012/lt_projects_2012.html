<h3>1. &nbsp;Microwave measurement of e-cloud using resonant cavity
technique<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Charles Thangaraj,
Bob Zwaska</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Phyo Aung Kyaw</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">The goal of this experimental
work will be to extend the bench setup on the microwave measurements
with proper boundary conditions, slit orientation and antenna
direction. After measuring and benchmarking certain parameters, the
student will add two short stubs on the pipe ends to match the boundary
conditions in an real experiments&nbsp; and make phase-shift
measurements. One of the objective of this work will be to find out
what is the minimum "ear width"&nbsp; that will maximize the phase
shift signal. At the end, the student will submit a report on this work
and present to the e-cloud group.</span><br>

<h3>2. Design of the 2nd bunch compressor in ASTA</h3>
<big>Mentor(s): Tanaji Sen, Philip Piot<br>
Student: Druv Kedar<br>
<br>
In the first phase of ASTA (Advanced Superconducting Test
Accelerator)&nbsp; the electron bunch will be compressed at a
relatively low energy (~40 MeV) resulting in a significant
deterioration of the bunch transverse phase space due to collective
effects such as space charge and coherent synchrotron radiation. The
plan is therefore to compress the bunch in two stages. The 40-MeV
compression stage will be used to partially compress the bunch with
tolerable phase space degradation and a second bunch compressor will
need to be installed after the bunch has been accelerated to higher
energies. The intern will explore possible designs for the second-stage
bunch compressor. A simple one-dimensional model will initially be used
to investigate and optimize the performance of a two-stage bunch
compression thereby leading to requirements on the second-stage bunch
compressor. Simulations including some of the collective effects with
the ELEGANT-code model of ASTA will be performed for further
optimization of the second bunch compressor.<br>
</big>
<h3>3. Multiparticle beam dynamics simulations of ASTA&nbsp;</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Philip Piot,</big><big> Tanaji Sen</big><br>
<big>Student: Yuan Hui Wu<br>
<br>
At&nbsp; ASTA, bunches containing up to 2E10 electrons will be
generated from the photoinjector. Such high-charge medium-energy (~40
MeV) bunches are prone to collective effects such as space charge. The
dynamical evolution of bunches needs to properly account for these
collective effects. The intern will develop an independent model of the
ASTA photoinjector using the PARMELA particle tracking program. This
independent model will be bench-marked against previous simulations and
will be further refined by including some collective effects available
in PARMELA including the bunch self-interaction with its radiated field
(via wakefields and coherent synchrotron radiation). The numerical
simulation model developed will then be used to perform parametric
studies of the bunch parameters for various bunch charge and
photoinjector configurations.<br>

<h3>4. Investigation and Operation of Superconducting RF Systems</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Elvin Harms, Mike Church</big><big></big><br>
<big>
Student: Jian Cong Zeng<br>
<br>
A second 8-cavity Superconducting RF cryomodule will be installed and
brought into operation at NML. Since this is the first such device
built entirely under Fermilab's direction, there will be a complete
dataset of test measurements made on the cavities and couplers. As
performance measurements are made on the cavities and input couplers,
it will be important to compare these test results against previous
single cavity ones to determine any degradation in performance and
possible sources. It will be necessary to both participate in upcoming
tests and access data from previous ones. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></big>
<h3>5. SRF cavity studies</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Anna Grassellino,Camille Ginsberg</big><br>
<big>
Student: Qinxia Wang<br>
<br>
Superconducting RF accelerating cavities are an important component of
all conceived future accelerator projects at Fermilab.&nbsp; While
their performance has improved dramatically in recent years, some
common performance limitations<br>
are known and must be repaired before cavities may be installed into an
accelerator.&nbsp; The student will participate in cavity qualification
studies, and contribute to the study of specific performance
limitations using thermometry and other diagnostic instrumentation, as
well as being introduced to repair techniques.&nbsp; The student will
learn the basic accelerator physics and fundamental superconducting
materials physics associated with SRF cavity acceleration. <br>

<h3>6. The New Ion Source and RFQ at the Fermilab Linac</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Bob Zwaska, C.Y. Tan, Dan Bollinger</big><br>
<big>
Student: Purnima Balakrishnan<br>
<br>
Fermilab is replacing its ion source and Cockcroft Walton accelerators
with a new ione source and RFQ.&nbsp; These new accelerators need to be
fully characterized in terms of their beam energy, distributions, and
operating conditions.&nbsp; This work involves high power RF, beam
instrumentation, and software reconstruction.<br>
<br>
</big>
<h3>7. Fast optical spectrometer to study electric breakdown in RF
cavities</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Katsuya Yonehara, Moses Chung</big><br>
<big>
Student: Adam Sibley<br>
<br>
The electric breakdown mechanism in an RF cavity remains a
mystery.&nbsp; The plasma dynamics is an essential to investigate the
mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp; In past measurement, the time evolution of
plasma formation was taken by using a streak camera.&nbsp; However, it
is very expensive and takes a picture only in a very short time
period.&nbsp;&nbsp; We propose to make a fast optical spectrometer
based on a high sensitive SiPM.&nbsp; We will investigate what the
light source is generated in the breakdown.&nbsp; We also plan to put a
light emitter in the cavity to investigate energy distribution of
plasma. <br>

<h3>8. Experiments with magnetically confined electron beams</h3>
<big>Mentor(s):&nbsp; Giulio Stancari</big><br>
<big>
Student: Siqi Li<br>
<br>
Experiments in the Fermilab Tevatron collider have shown that<br>
low-energy, magnetically confined hollow electron beams can be used to<br>
control the halo of the circulating beam. Electron guns developed for<br>
this purpose are tested in the Fermilab electron-lens test stand. The<br>
Lee Teng intern will design improvements to the experimental setup and<br>
characterize the properties of the hollow electron beam.<br>

<h3>3. &nbsp;Cryomodule Test System<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Genfa Wu, Goeff
Waldschmidt</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Stephen Bauman</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">ANL is developing
superconducting cryomodule for short pulse X-ray generation (SPX0). The
critical component of SPX0 cryomodule is a deflecting cavity made of
superconducting material: niobium. The niobium cavity will be processed
chemically and heat treated in UHV vacuum furnace at 600 C. Its
performance will be tested under superfluid liquid helium temperature
(2K) before it can be integrated into a final cryomodule.&nbsp; The
effort will be focused on horizontal cavity test, where one needs to
simulate the thermal profiles of RF waveguides leading to SRF cavity in
a cryostat. A cavity test will help verify the simulation result and
improve the simulation model to assist the similar design of cryomodule
components. Some existing labview software needs to be improved to
support this test. To support the cavity test, a simple thermometer
data acquisition using carbon thermometers is being developed. The
experiment uses constant current source; an accurate voltage
measurement at low temperature is required. Some signal processing is
needed to improve the accuracy.&nbsp;</span></h3>
<h3>4. Developing an improved machine model for ATLAS<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): Richard Pardo</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: Taylor Clarke</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br>
ATLAS (the Argonne Tandem-Linac Accelerator System) is a national user<br>
facility for nuclear physics research.&nbsp; Experimenters from all
over the<br>
world come to Argonne to conduct experiments in in nuclear astrophysics,<br>
nuclear structure and material science with the heavy ion beams from the<br>
ATLAS Accelerator.&nbsp; Every few days the beam delivered changes and
can range<br>
from protons to uranium.&nbsp; This summer project will develop an
improved<br>
accelerator beam modeling program that more seamlessly merges the<br>
accelerator control system with an off-line simulation tool known as
TRACK.<br>
The student will not need to perform 'hard core' programming, but will
learn<br>
to access information from databases, automatically create a text file
and<br>
work with accelerator equipment to perform calibrations and them compare<br>
actual performance to model predictions.<br>
