<h1 style="text-align: center;">Lee Teng Internship Information for Foreign Students</h1>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
The Lee Teng Internship is open to all students enrolled at US
Universities, regardless of nationality, provided they are legally
attending the university and are legally allowed to work in the US,
with the exception of those born in countries that have been designated
<a href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm">"State Sponsors of Terror" (SST)</a> - currently <span style="font-weight: bold;">Iran, Syria, and Soudan</span>.&nbsp; Students born in one of those countries are not eligible for this internship unless they are currently <span style="font-style: italic;">American</span>
citizens; that is, those who have become citizens of another country
remain inelegible, even it that third country is not on the SST list.<br>
<br>
For those students who are eligible, citizenship and/or country of origin play no part in our selection process.&nbsp; <br>
<h2>Work Authorization Requirements</h2>
To the students who are admitted to the program, we will offer whatever
advice and assistance we can regarding work authorization requirements,
with the understanding that the students themselves are ultimately
responsible for understanding and satisfying those requirements.&nbsp; Let me make this clear: <span style="font-weight: bold;">we will not initiate any work authorization formalities on your behalf</span>.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We can make no promises, but as of 2016, we admitted 98 students into
the Lee Teng Program over 9 years, of which 38 were foreign nationals,
representing 15 different countries.&nbsp; Of those 38, we only had two
serious visa issues. In both cases, it was because the student ignored
all our advice and reminders and <span style="font-style: italic;">simply neglected to start the authorization process at all</span>.&nbsp;
In no case has a student properly applied for authorization and failed
to obtain it (although we've cut it close a few times).&nbsp; On the
other hand, two problems is two too many, which is why I made this page.<br>
<br>
The requirements for authorization to work at one of the labs depend on your particular visa
type and the disposition of your university regarding summer
internships.&nbsp; For this reason, if you are admitted to the program,
we strongly advise you to contact the foreign affairs office at your university as soon as possible.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Here are the general requirements for the types of visas we've
encountered, in order of how common they are, with the caveat that you
should verify information relevant to your own situation for yourself:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">F1 Student Visa (the most common):</span>&nbsp; There are two possibilities for F1 students: an easy one and a hard one.&nbsp; Which one you must pursue depends <span style="font-style: italic;">entirely</span> on your university.<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/complete-section-1-employee-information-and-attestation/foreign-students#nonimmigrant%20status"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CPT (Easy)</span></a>:&nbsp;
We believe that internships like ours are an integral part of a
technical or scientific education, and most universities agree. If they
do, then the "Designated Signature Officer" (DSO) at the university
must sign a "Curricular&nbsp; Practical Training" (CPT) authorization
on your I-20. No further authorization or review is required.&nbsp;
Note, however, that the amount of paperwork required for a CPT varies
greatly from university to university, from trivial to fairly
significant.&nbsp; We
will do everything we can to convince the university that our
internship qualifies as CPT, but the decision is ultimately up to them,
which may result in...</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/complete-section-1-employee-information-and-attestation/foreign-students#optional%20OPT"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OPT (Hard)</span></a>: If the university <span style="font-style: italic;">does not</span>
agree with this assessment, then you must apply to the US Customs and
Immigration Service for an "Optional Practical Training" (OPT)
authorization.&nbsp; This costs money, and takes time. If you find
yourself in this situation, you need to submit the paperwork as soon as
possible.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">J1 Student Visa:</span>&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Academic Training"</span>: students on a J1 visa must obtain a signed "Academic Training" authorization.&nbsp;
This is like the CPT, but the standard is less stringent: the internship must simply
be related to their education, rather than an integal part of it.&nbsp;
We feel our internship easily satisfies this requirement; however,
unlike the CPT, there is no recourse if the university does not agree
with this assessment.&nbsp; There's no good USCIS page for this topic,
but here's a <a href="http://global.lehigh.edu/oiss/immigration/j-1-academic-training">description at Lehigh University</a> that's not bad.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Green Card:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>No further action is required.</li>
  </ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">DACA ("Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals")</a>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>DACA students must have an Employment Authorization Document (<span style="font-weight: bold;">EAD</span>)&nbsp; and Employment Authorization Card (<span style="font-weight: bold;">EAC</span>) valid for the period of the internship.&nbsp; If you do not have already these, you should fill out an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-765">I-765</a> form immediately.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Verification</h2>
Like all government contractors, our labs use the "<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify">E-Verify</a>"
automated I-9 authorization system.&nbsp; Once you believe you have
satisfied the work authorization requirements, you are strongly
encouraged to verify your own eligibility at their <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/mye-verify/self-check">self-check page</a>.&nbsp;
The law is very clear that we cannot compel you to do this, ask the
result, or base any of our decisions on that result; however, by law we
also cannot enter your information into our E-verify system until after
you start employment.&nbsp; If at that point, the result comes back
that you are ineligible, then not only will you be immediately
terminated, but you <span style="font-style: italic;">will have violated the terms of your visa</span>, and once that has happened, it's unlikely we can to anything to remedy the situation.&nbsp; This in fact happened to a
student, and in addition to being terminated, his actions risked
<span style="font-weight: bold;">expulsion and deportation</span> - which thankfully did not occur.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if we know there are problems with your
authorization beforehand, we can work with you and your university to solve them, perhaps
even delaying your start date if necessary.&nbsp; This also has
happened with a student, and we were able to avert total disaster in
that case, simply by shifting the internship a week later while the issues were sorted out.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it would almost certainly be to your advantage to
voluntarily inform us of any problems you uncover with your E-Verify
self-check, and in all cases to be completely honest with us.<br>
<br>
<h2>Lab Access</h2>
Access to the labs for foreign nationals is a separate issue
from work authorization; however, this requires no action on your part
other than providing us with any requested information and/or
documentation in a timely manner.<br>
