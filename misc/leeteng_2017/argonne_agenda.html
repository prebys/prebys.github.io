Guidelines for talks:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Each talk should be NO LONGER than 10 MINUTES!&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>This means 4-6 slides (not including title slide) depending on how much you talk per slide.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>A decent talk might be organized as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp; It is good to begin the talk by saying what your project
is, and why it is important (i.e. context in the field of accelerator
science) - slide 1.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>Then, state what the project goals are, and your particular role in meeting those goals - slide 2.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>*Briefly* describe how you worked to meet those goals - slide 3, <br>
    </li>
    <li>and what results you had - slide 4. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
