<h3>1.&nbsp; Comissioning of Interferometer<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:assoufid@APS.ANL.GOV">Lahsen Assoufid</a></span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:ammercad@uark.edu">Alejandro Mercado</a>, University of Arkansas<br>
</span></h3>The selected candidate will participate in the
commissioning of a recently acquired state-of-the-art interferometer
and contribute to the development for a procedure for metrology
measurement of ultra-precise x-ray focusing mirrors with shape errors
in the nanometer range. The project involves experimental work as well
as data processing, analysis and manipulation using numerical methods
with computer programming. <br>
<br>Requirements<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Math, physics, and basic optics</li>
  <li>Ability to conduct experimental work</li>
  <li>Data manipulation and analysis</li>
  <li>Computer programming using one or more of the following languages: Matlab, Python, IDL, </li>
</ul>




<h3>2. Development of Stripling Kicker for APS<br>
</h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:zconway@anl.gov">Zachary Conway</a></span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:ys743@cornell.edu">Yifan Su</a>, Cornell University</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>The newly proposed
Advanced Photon Source Upgrade storage ring will operate with a
transverse electron beam size &lt; 100 pm, much less than the present
value of 3.1 mm.&nbsp; This small beam size is not compatible with
traditional techniques of injecting electrons into a storage ring which
rely on multi-turn damping.&nbsp; To overcome this limitation we are
developing a set of new nano-second rise-time strip-line kickers to
transfer the 6 GeV electron beam from the injector to stable orbits
within the proposed storage ring.&nbsp; In this project, the interested
student will help with the design of a new strip-line kicker and with
measurements characterizing geometric perturbations on our initial
prototype.&nbsp; It is expected that the student is comfortable with
electrodynamics and interested in learning to use our existing software
simulation packages.<br><br>
Requirements:<br>

<h3>3.&nbsp; Analysis of Cross-correlator<br>
</h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:dooling@aps.anl.gov">Jeff Dooling</a>, Yine Sun </span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:dgutie10@hawk.iit.edu">Diego Gutieriez Coronel</a>, Illinois Institute of Technology<br>
 </span></h3>Analyze
the response of a combined auto- and cross-correlator (ACC) optical
system used for measuring the green and UV laser pulse duration of the
Advanced Photon Source photocathode (PC) drive laser system. Data from
the ACC provides important information on UV laser&#8217;s longitudinal
distribution. Together with the transverse profile, the 3D shape of the
drive laser plays a critical role as the initial conditions of electron
bunch emission from the PC rf gun. The space charge force of the
electron beam drives the need for emittance compensation and
preservation at the front end of the linac (prior to acceleration after
the gun), and affects the achievable transverse emittances (&#949;x, &#949;y)
from the gun. We seek to maximize the brightness (~I/(&#949;x &#949;y)) of the PC
Gun beam. The student will not be operating or working with the
high-power drive laser, but may use low-power lasers (Class 2).<br>

<h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Requirements:<br></h3>
<ul>
  <li>A good understanding of electromagnetics and optics</li></ul><h3>4.&nbsp; Charge Measurement with Beam Position Monitor<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:JP@anl.gov">John Power</a> </span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:chuanyin@uchicago.edu">Chuan Yin</a>, University of Chicago</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h3>The Argonne Wakefield
Accelerator (AWA) group is developing a compact, low-cost, complete
Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system which consists of three components
[(i) signal pickup device, (ii) processing electronics, and (iii) a
simple readout] aimed at medical accelerators and small-scale
accelerator facilities.&nbsp; The BPM system will be capable of
measuring both the 0th moment (charge) and the 1st moment (horizontal
&amp; vertical position).&nbsp;&nbsp; The project for the student will
be to develop the processing electronics with guidance from AWA
accelerator scientists.<br>
The signal pickup device is an in-flange button-type BPM purchased from
MDC vacuum which is already installed on the AWA witness
beamline.&nbsp; Given the short duration of the summer student&#8217;s stay,
this will allow the student to make quick progress.<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Completed a course in electromagnetism <br>
  </li>
  <li>Basic understanding of accelerator physics</li>
  <li>Programming skills (e.g. Matlab, Mathematica, etc.)<br>

<h3>5. Design of a Novel 300GHz Wave Guide<br>
</h3><h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">Mentor(s): <a href="mailto:suthar@anl.gov">Kamlesh Suthar</a></span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Student: <a href="mailto:hector12336@live.com">Hector Perez</a>, IIT</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br>Accelerator Science division is
developing a novel corrugated waveguide that operates at 300GHz. The
inner diameter of beam tube is 2mm and the internal corrugated
structures are about 100 microns in size. The challenge of designing
the structure lies in fabrication and assembly since the entire 1m-long
structure may not be built in one piece and shorter pieces may be
needed to be joined to produce a long structure. Initial RF simulation
indicates that roughly 20W/cm power is expected to be distributed
during operation. This structure is required to be cooled by water
circulating tube attached next to this main structure. The impedance of
wall is responsible for the heating.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">The student will work in a team
of physicists and engineers to analyze this structure using finite
element analysis software and optimize the thermo-mechanical design via
integration of responsible physics. <br>

Requirements:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-physics simulation</li>
  <li>Finite element analysis</li>
  <li>Novel fabrication techniques<br>
