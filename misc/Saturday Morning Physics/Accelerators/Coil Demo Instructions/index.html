beam of electrons and a Helmholtz coil to create magnetic field to bend
these electrons into a circular path.<br>

Figure1 shows the detail and the theory of operation of the tube.&nbsp;
A heated filament creates a beam of a electrons, which is accelerated
by a potential of up to 300 V.&nbsp; A small cylinder, called a
"Wehnelt Cylinder" is biased slightly negative to focus the
electrons.&nbsp; The velocity of the electrons is given by:<br>

<br>
A pair of Helmholtz coils is used to create a magnetic field and bend
the electron beam into a circular path, as shown in Figure 2.&nbsp; The
magnetic field is given by<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 199px; height: 85px;" alt="" src="field.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<br>
And this bends the electron beam into a radius given by<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 181px; height: 242px;" alt="" src="force.png"><br>

When we put the equations together, we get a dependence of the radius on the accelerating voltage and coil current given by<br>

Figure 3<br>
</div>
<br>
Figure 3 shows the integrated power supply for the system, along with
the special wire harness to make all the connections. This supply
provides the four voltage which are required:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Accelerating Voltage (AV):&nbsp; The positive potential used to accelerate the electron (0 to 300V)</li>
  <li>Wehnelt Cylinder Voltage (WV): The negative potential used to focus the electrons (0 to -50V)</li>
  <li>Filament Voltage (FV): This provides the filament current to generate electrons (FIXED at 6.3V)</li>
  <li>Coil
Votage (CV): This provides the current for the Helmoltz Coil (0 to 12V,
4A max).&nbsp; With the present coils, it hits the current limit at
about 7V.<br>
</li>
</ul>
The wire harness connects ground to the negative pole of each of the
sources, except the Wehnelt bias, where the positive pole is
grounded.&nbsp; <br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 720px; height: 540px;" alt="" src="tube_connections.png"><br>
Figure 4<br>
</div>
Figure 4 shows how these power sources are connected to the tube holder.&nbsp;
There are connections for deflecting plates on the right, which are not
used.&nbsp; It's important that these be shorted to the accelerating
voltage with the three connector jumper.<br>

Figure 5<br>
</div>The coil inputs on the side panel are connected to coil
connectors on fixture.&nbsp; The two sides are connected to put the two
coils in series with the indicated polarity. Figure 5 shows the
connections to the Helmholtz Coil.&nbsp; Current should flow in both
coils <span style="font-style: italic;">in the same direction as the electrons</span>.<br>

Figure 6<br>
</div>
<br>The beam is very faint, and only visible in complete
darkness.&nbsp; To
use the demo in a lecture all, you'll have to cover the system with an
opaque shroud and use a camera.&nbsp; In the past, we have enlisted
<a href="mailto:rhahn@fnal.gov">Reidar Hahn</a> or <a href="mccrory@fnal.gov">Elliott McCrory</a> to use their cameras, and it has worked
extremely well.&nbsp; If they are not available, we have purchased
a&nbsp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Desktop-Laptop-Webcam-Camera/dp/B00CRJWW2G">Logitech 930e webcam</a>
and tripod for this purpose (Figure 6).&nbsp; You can position the
camera very close to the tube, so the box the equipment is in can be
used as a dark shroud, as shown.<br>
<br>
With the default
settings, you will not be able to see the beam.&nbsp; You will need to
modify the camera settings by using the Logitech Gaming Software, which
can be downloaded <a href="http://support.logitech.com/en_in/software/lgs">here</a>.&nbsp;
Connect the camera and launch the software.&nbsp; Click on the "Webcam
Settings" icon near the bottom right, select "Advanced", and make the following changes:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Gain: Uncheck "Auto" and set to 100%</li>
  <li>Saturation: 100%</li>
  <li>Contrast: 0% <br>
  </li>
</ul>
Then go to the "Webcam
control" tab and make the following changes<br>
<ul>
  <li>Exposure: uncheck "Auto" and set to 100%&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the image of the filament is not clear, you may need to
uncheck "Auto" on Focus, and manipulated it manually (not usually
necessary).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Finally, go back to the
"Advanced" tab and adjust the "Brightness" for best picture.&nbsp; Note
that the longer exposure will reduce the frame rate, but this should be
OK.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Keep the gaming software open, as you may need to visit the settings again (see below).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To view the webcam using, e.g, <a href="https://support.apple.com/quicktime">Quicktime</a>,
lauch the program, then do "File-&gt;New Movie Recording", and select
the Logitech Webcam from the pulldown below the little red dot.&nbsp;
You don't actually need to start a recording.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: </span>starting Quicktime <span style="font-style: italic;">will probably reset the exposure to the default</span>,
causing the image of the beam to suddenly disappear, so you will need
to set it back to maximum as described above.&nbsp; Other things, like
changing screen resolution by connecting a display, may also reset the
exposure.&nbsp; Once Quicktime is displaying correctly, you can go to
full screen mode.<br>
<h2><a name="Operation"></a>Operation</h2>
Initially, all voltages should be set to zero.&nbsp; Switch the supply
on, then set the filament voltage (third knob from left) to <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly</span>
6.3V.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do not change this!&nbsp;</span> Exceeding this voltage could permanently damage the filament, ruining the device. <br>
<br>
Reasonable initial settings for
the other supplies are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Accelerating Voltage (AV): 150V</li>
  <li>Wehnelt Voltage (WV): -20V</li>
  <li>Coil Voltage (CV): 4V</li>
</ul>
It takes a couple of minutes for the beam to become visible and about
five minutes to reach maximum brightness.&nbsp; Once it has, you can
use the accelerating voltage and magnetic field to adjust the radius of
the electron path, as illustrated in <a href="demonstration.mov">this video</a>&nbsp;
(time sped up). As you change the accelerating voltage, you'll need to
vary the Wehnelt voltage to maximize the beam's brightness.&nbsp; Note
that with the present coils, the coil supply hits the 4A current limit
at about 7V.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Key_Points_in_Demonstration"></a>Key Points in Demonstration</h2>
Ask the students which way the field has to point to bend electrons a
circle, and which way the current needs to flow to generate that field.<br>
<br>
Demonstrate that increasing the accelerating voltage increases the radius of curvature, as in a <span style="font-style: italic;">cyclotron</span>, but that simultaneously increasing the coil voltage can keep the radius constant, as in a <span style="font-style: italic;">synchrotron</span>.<br>
