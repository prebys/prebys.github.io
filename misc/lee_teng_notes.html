<h2><a name="General"></a>General</h2>
The Lee Teng internship is a 10 week program that includes two weeks at
the <a href="http://uspas.fnal.gov/">USPAS</a>.&nbsp; It's a joint program with Argonne, in which we usually
accept 5 interns at each lab.&nbsp; The selection is handled by a joint
committee, after which the programs are adminstered separately at the
two labs.&nbsp; We line up the nominal dates of the program with the
DOE/SULI program, because it makes logistics easier at Fermilab, where
students are grouped in off site housing.&nbsp; This means they either
start one or two weeks before the USPAS, depending on the year.&nbsp;
That schedule doesn't accomodate tri-mester schools, so we have
historically allowed such students to shift their schedule a week or
two, provided they arrive in to to take the full two-week USPAS course.<br>
<br>
I have four mailing lists related to the program:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="mailto:leetenginternship@fnal.gov">leetenginternship@fnal.gov</a>:&nbsp; This is the official contact address.&nbsp; It goes to the program director and Rosa<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="mailto:leetengselection@fnal.gov">leetengselection@fnal.gov</a>:&nbsp; This is used for communication among the <a href="#committee">selection committee</a></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:leeteng_fermilab@fnal.gov">leeteng_fermilab@fnal.gov</a>:&nbsp; Interns and mentors for fermilab, as well as program director and Rosa</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:leeteng_argonne@fnal.gov">leeteng_argonne@fnal.gov</a>: Interns and mentors at Argonne, plus Linda Spentzsouris</li>
  <li><a href="mailto:leeteng_alumni@fnal.gov">leeteng_alumni@fnal.gov</a>:
Every year, I move the students from the lab lists to the alumni list,
prior to adding the new students.&nbsp; I ocassionally reach out to
this list, to see what people, but in many cases the email address they
had at the time they were interns no longer works.</li>
</ul>
I have added you to all the lists and made you an owner.&nbsp; I have
left myself on for the moment, but you can take me off when I'm no
longer useful.<br>

<br>
At Fermilab, all the practical details of the internship (travel, housing, cars, etc) are handled by <a href="mailto:rosa@fnal.gov">Rosa Foote</a>,
who is also handling all the other internships, except SIST.&nbsp; This
makes your life a lot easier!&nbsp; Things are a little more
complicated at Argonne.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:linda@agni.phys.iit.edu">Linda Spentzouris</a> is your primary contact, and the details are handled by a number of different people. &nbsp;
<h2><a name="Website_and_Advertising_"></a>Website and Advertising<br>
</h2>
The official website for the internship is <a href="http://www.illinoisacceleratorinstitute.org/">http://www.illinoisacceleratorinstitute.org/</a>.&nbsp; It's maintained by <a href="mailto:jaje@anl.gov">Kelly Jaje</a> at ANL.&nbsp; Every year, I give her information regarding:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Before the program <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>New application information</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Details of USPAS</li>
    <li>Link to current year website<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>At the end</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Final talks and papers to put in the "Previous years" area</li>
  </ul>
</ul>Note that there have been several instances of difficulty in
accessing this page from outside Argonne, so keep an eye on it. There
is also a <a href="http://ed.fnal.gov/interns/programs/iai/index.shtml">Fermilab page</a> regarding the internship.&nbsp; You'll need to make sure it's consistent and up to date.<br>
<br>
Every year, we've made posters to advertise the program, and I sent
them out to a <a href="#Mailing_list">mailing list</a>
that has grown over the years.&nbsp; Last
year, I added "How did you hear about the program?" to the application,
and the vast majority were divided between "word of mouth" and
"internet search", with only two selecting "poster" - so spending money
to print and mail posters is probably not the best use of
resources.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
You can decide if you want to produce them and
send email copies to people.&nbsp; If so, I normally work with <a href="mailto:dbrandonisio@fnal.gov">Diana
Brandonisio</a> in VMS, although the request has to go through <a href="mailto:kseifrid@fnal.gov">Karen Seifrid</a>. Diana has a template, and every year she just updates the USPAS part,
uses the student picture from the previous year, and changes the
background color.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I always create a working website for the summer.&nbsp; This is where I
put general information for the students, list the projects, publish
the calendar, etc. These pages are at my Fermilab web area, which they
promise me will not go away.&nbsp; Recent years can be found at:<br>

<h2><a name="Application"></a>Application</h2>
I'm overjoyed to dump this issue in someone else's lap!  <br>
<br>We have traditionally used an SQL script written by Liz Quigg. It's
not
perfect, but it did the job.&nbsp; A couple years ago, HR started
pushing the internships to start using their HODES system.&nbsp; At the
time, HODES was completely inadequate for our
needs (e.g. no way to submit reference letters).&nbsp; They tried to
simply force it on everyone, but the internships banded together to
stop them.&nbsp; Tim ironed out an agreement where they would work with
the
internships to come up with an acceptable program - which of course
never happened.&nbsp; Last year, they tried to force their system -
which by then had been improved - on everyone.&nbsp; Sasha Valishev and
I refused to use it because we didn't have enough time to properly
evaluate it, and continued to use Liz's system.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:mccrory@fnal.gov">Elliott McCrory</a>
did use the new system for SIST, and I guess it wasn't all that
horrible, but you might also want to talk to <a href="mailto:scharles@fnal.gov">Sandra Charles</a>.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<br>
Anyway, Liz either has or will retire, so using her system is no longer
an option.&nbsp; The right answer would be to use Academic Jobs Online,
but that meets with a lot of resistance (for reasons I don't
understand).&nbsp; Whatever you decide, you and <a href="mailto:valishev@fnal.gov">Sasha Valishev</a> should
form a united front on this (IMHO).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h4><a name="Application_Materials"></a>Application Materials</h4>
We ask for:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Basic information</li>
  <li>an essay</li>
  <li>Two letters</li>
  <li>An unofficial transcript. We used to ask for an official one, but
that costs money and takes time, so we stopped.&nbsp; We reserve the
right to ask for an official one if they are accepted.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Deadline"></a>Deadline</h4>
We originally set our deadline to be the same as SULI, which was around
Feb 8th.&nbsp; Over the last few years, I noticed that our yield
(particularly for women) was going down, because they had already
accepted other internships.&nbsp; I checked and the SULI deadline had
been creeping up, so last year I reset ours to match at January
13th.&nbsp; As a result, the number of applications went down
dramatically, but our yield did go back up.&nbsp; I think that's a
little early, so I'd split the difference and make it something like
January 20th, but of course that's your call. <br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Mentors_and_Selection"></a>Mentors and Selection</h2>
This is entirely the new director's call, but here's what we did...<br>
<br>
We bring the mentors into the selection process.&nbsp; This is a real
pain, but both the mentors and the students seem to be happier with the
matches.&nbsp; This means picking the mentors before or early in the
selection process.&nbsp; We tend to draw from the same pool of mentors,
although there's pressure from the Directorate to branch out a
bit.&nbsp; I normally lined up the Fermilab mentors myself, and you can
find a list of previous mentors by going to the pages above and
clicking on the "Projects" links.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:linda@agni.phys.iit.edu">Linda Spentzouris</a> lines up the mentors at Argonne.<br>
<br>
<a name="committee"></a>Last year's selection committee was:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Fermilab</li>
  <ul>
    <li>me (Chair)</li>
    <li><a href="mailto:stancari@fnal.gov">Giulio Stancari</a></li>
    <li><a href="mailto:mlwong@fnal.gov">Mayling Wong-Squires</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Argonne</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="mailto:preissner@aps.anl.gov">Curt Preissner</a></li>
    <li><a href="mailto:berenc@aps.anl.gov">Tim Berenc</a><br>
    </li>
    <li><a href="mailto:linda@agni.phys.iit.edu">Linda Spentzouris</a> (really IIT, but paid by Argonne for this role)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
They can be contacted via the <a href="mailto:leetengselection@fnal.gov">leetengselection@fnal.gov</a> mailing list.<br>
<br>
Our selection process varied a bit, but it normally went something like this<br>
<ul>
  <li>I assigned every application two readers.&nbsp; I randomized it
so the same two readers didn't read the same applications.&nbsp; I
tweaked things so engineering applicants would be read by an engineer
with a similar background.</li>
  <li>Readers divided applicants into top, mid, and bottom.</li>
  <li>We got together and used this for form a first cut.&nbsp;
Normally cases where both readers put someone in the top were kept, as
second group would be read by the entire group.&nbsp; Our goal was to
end up with a short list of ~20 students.</li>
  <li>From this group, we found 4 or 5 best matches for each of the projects and send these to the mentor, who would rank order them.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>NOTE!&nbsp; Make sure the mentors know they only have to read
those applications!&nbsp; No matter how clear I was on this, a couple
of mentors would read ALL the applications at this point.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>I would try to match students to mentors.&nbsp; Usually, every mentor would get their first or second choice,.</li>
</ul>
At this point, I would send out email acceptances, with a 7-10 day
deadline.&nbsp; From this point on, the formal hiring process was
separate at each lab.<br>
<ul>
  <li>At Fermilab, <a href="mailto:rosa@fnal.gov">Rosa Foote</a> manages ALL logistics, including offers, travel, housing, and cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Things are a bit more complicated at Argonne.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:linda@agni.phys.iit.edu">Linda Spentzouris</a> shepherds the process, and <a href="mailto:lisareed@anl.gov">Lisa Reed</a>
handles a lot of stuff, but parts are handled within the divisions of
the individual mentors.&nbsp; You should just check into things once in
a while, to make sure nothing fell through the cracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Visa_Issues"></a>Visa Issues</h2>Suffice to say you should
keep on top of this issue yourself, rather than assuming someone else
will deal with it. I can't stress this enough.<br>
<br>
Lee Teng accepts students legally attending US universities, regardless
of nationality, with the exception of State Sponsors of Terror (Libya,
Soudan, and Syria).&nbsp; Foreign students are responsible for
satisfying any visa formalities required to work at a summer
internship.&nbsp; Last year, I put together <a href="http://home.fnal.gov/%7Eprebys/misc/leeteng_2017/foreign_students.html">this guide</a> for foreign students.&nbsp; You should become familiar with it and keep it up to date, as some things (e.g. DACA) may change.<br>
<br>
If you have questions, <a href="mailto:vstanley@fnal.gov">Valery Stanley</a> in the Visa Office is a very good resource.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h2><a name="USPAS"></a>USPAS</h2>
Attending the <a href="http://uspas.fnal.gov">USPAS</a> is an important
part of the program.&nbsp; In the past, we've gotten some money to at
least partically support the Lee Teng students, but the exact amount
has varied, and the general trend has been downward.&nbsp; You should
talk to <a href="mailto:uspas@fnal.gov">Susan Winchester at USPAS</a> to see what the arrangement will be this year.&nbsp; Make sure she gets the list of students as soon as you have it.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Calendar_and_Deliverables"></a>Calendar and Deliverables</h2>
The calendar has undergone some tweaking.&nbsp; Basically, we like
events that involve all the interns, but don't want to cut into their
work time any more than we already do.&nbsp; There's also an issue of
maintaining an appropriate balance between the two labs.&nbsp; If you
take a look at <a href="http://home.fnal.gov/%7Eprebys/misc/leeteng_2017/lt_calendar.html">this calendar</a>, you'll see what we arrived at.&nbsp; The main features are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Fermilab visit near the beginning, including tours.&nbsp; I try
to coordinate this with the Users' Meeting if possible, because this
can often result in free food.<br>
  </li>
  <li>U of Chicago visit some time in the middle.&nbsp; This year, we
did it on a Saturday to minimize the impact, and no one complained.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Make arrangements with <a href="mailto:eweaston@uchicago.edu">Emily Whitman Easton</a> at U of C.</li>
    <li>At Fermilab, we have traditionally coordinated the trip with the Helen Edwards (formerly PARTI) students.&nbsp; Talk to <a href="mailto:valishev@fnal.gov">Sasha Valishev</a> about this.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Argonne students come to Fermilab to take part in the Fermilab
intern poster sessions (this was considered a major success by
everyone).&nbsp; No tours this time.</li>
  <li>Fermilab students go to Argonne to do tours and deliver their final talks.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
</ul>
So the deliverables are a talk, a poster, and a paper.&nbsp; I always
set up a single Indico page (located on the calendar),&nbsp; where
students can upload all of these.<br>
<br>
There are also a series of events for all interns, organized by
Rosa.&nbsp; You can advise the Lee Teng students which ones&nbsp; you
think are important, given that they have more distractions than the
other interns.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Miscellaneous"></a>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h4><a name="Program_Statistics"></a>Program Statistics</h4>
I've maintained <a href="lee_teng_statistics_2017.xlsx">this spreadsheet</a> with information on all the interns in the program to date.&nbsp; I hope you will keep it up.&nbsp; <br>
<h4><a name="Mailing_list"></a>Advertising Mailing list</h4>
<a href="posters.xlsx">This is the mailing list</a> I put together to
send posters.&nbsp; I made a point to target historically
underrepresented groups (women's colleges, historically black colleges,
etc).&nbsp; As I said above, I don't think mailing posters is worth the
money, but perhaps you can advertise to these universities in other
ways.<br>
<h4><a name="Computing_for_Interns"></a>Computing for Interns!</h4>
Internships are short, and time wasted on basic computer issues can really cut into them.&nbsp; For Fermilab students, I made <a href="AAAreadme/fermilab_computing_for_interns.html">this guide</a>
to address all the basic issues that have come up again and
again.&nbsp; Of course, this stuff gets stale really fast, so hopefully
someone will take it over and maintain it.<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="Transportation"></a>Transportation</h4>
<a href="mailto:linda@agni.phys.iit.edu">Linda Spentzouris</a> has
always arranged all the transportation for the Argonne students.&nbsp;
At Fermilab, you can reserve the FermiTaxi buses to take you anywhere
(including Argonne and U of Chicago!) <span style="font-style: italic;">free of charge,</span> except for driver overtime if it goes out of normal working hours.&nbsp; Contact <a href="mailto:bniesman@fnal.gov">Brian Niesman</a> and <a href="mailto:dmyers@fnal.gov">David Myers</a> to make arrangements.  <br>
