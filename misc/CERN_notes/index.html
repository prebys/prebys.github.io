<h1><a href="http://home.fnal.gov/%7Eprebys/">Eric</a>'s Notes on Life at <a href="http://home.cern/">CERN</a></h1>Here are some of my random notes about
what do while one is working at CERN, with the caveat that some of my
information may be out of date, and other people know a lot more.<br>
<h2>General</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">You can find a general guide for newcomers <a href="http://newcomersguide.web.cern.ch/">here</a>.<br>
<br>
Remember, you'll cross the border a lot between Switzerland and
France.&nbsp; Switzerland has never joined the EU, and still uses Swiss
Francs instead of Euros.&nbsp; A lot of places will take both, but
generally give you a bad rate on cash.&nbsp; Credit/cash cards are
better, or you get local money from cash machines.&nbsp; If you don't
have a PIN for your credit card, call and see if they'll send you one,
because European stores expect it.&nbsp; You can usually manage without
it, but it will complicate transactions a bit, particularly if you
don't speak French very well.&nbsp; Speaking of which...<br>
<br>
You can get by pretty well in English at CERN and in Geneva, but if you
go elsewhere, you'll definitely want to learn some basic French.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Although they didn't join the EU, Switzerland did join the "Schengen
Agreement" on common immigration a few years ago, which made things
much easier. It means there's
no immigration control at the border any more, and you no longer have
to go through Swiss imimgration if you transfer at another European
airport.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
France is a bit cheaper than Geneva, when it comes to living or eating
out.&nbsp; There used to be a bigger difference, but it's still true at
some level.&nbsp; <br>
<br>Geneva has a great public transportation system, and the tram now
comes all the way to CERN. Driving in the city should be avoided at all
costs.&nbsp; There's a bus which will take you to St. Genis and
Ferney-Voltaire in France, but it doesn't run very often. <br>
</div>
<h2>Restaurants</h2>
Lots and lots.&nbsp; Here are a few of my favorites.<br>
<br>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.novae-restauration.ch/menus/?x=d894ddae3c17b40b4fe7e16519f950f0&amp;y=c7b3f79848b99a8e562a1df1d6285365&amp;z=33">Restaurant 1 at CERN</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Not greatest restaurant, but not bad,
and they have
beer and wine, It's also kind of the center of social life at the
lab.&nbsp; People
tend to gather there after work and have a few drinks, and it will
often evolve into a plan for the evening.&nbsp; If you're a....more
mature...person, you invariably run into people you haven't seen in
years.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.boisjoly.com/?lang=en">Le Bois Joly</a><br>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is an <span style="font-weight: bold;">absolute must</span> at least once!&nbsp; Up the hills toward the Jura.&nbsp; Good food, decent prices, and an absolutely <span style="font-style: italic;">incredible</span>
view.&nbsp; You can make a day of it and take the telepherique to hike
the Jura, then finish up with dinner.&nbsp; Reservations for the deck
recommended on nice days.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.restaurantlecoqrouge.fr/index.php/en/">Le Coq Rouge</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Right in St. Genis, just across the French border.&nbsp; On the same
square with Charly's Pub (which you'll get to know).&nbsp; Good food,
and the prices aren't bad.&nbsp; The lower priced fixed menu is usually
plenty, and they have a great cheese cart for dessert.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.laviation.ch/site/fr/">Cafe Restaurant de L'Aviation</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A CERN tradition.&nbsp; As the name
suggests, it's near the airport.&nbsp; Their specialty is a steak
frites with a heavy garlic cream pepper sauce, called a
"caravelle".&nbsp; It takes some years off&nbsp; your life, but it's
worth it.&nbsp; The trick is that is long as there's steak on your
plate, they'll keep bringing you more frites and sauce (although
they're much stingier than they used to be.).<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.pizz-azzurra.fr/">L'Azzura Pizzeria</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Nice, reasonably priced pizza place in Ferney Voltaire, France.&nbsp; <br>
</div><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.bains-des-paquis.ch/">Bain de Paquis</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is a hidden gem.&nbsp; A lot of
CERN people don't even know about it.&nbsp; It's not really a
restaurant.&nbsp; It's a swimming area on a little artificial island on
Lake Geneva, but the cafe has good food at a good price, and the it's a
great place to hang out on a nice day.&nbsp; You have to pay a franc or
two to get in, but it's worth it, whether you swim or not.&nbsp; I
learned about this place from a former colleague who left physics to go
into lucrative career in Swiss banking - but is still so tight he
squeaks. <br>
<br>
Not to
be confused with "The Paquis", which is the nearby red light
district.&nbsp; Note, there are also some nice bars and restaurants in
the red light district, which - being Swiss - is perfectly safe.<br>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Places to visit in and around Geneva</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Lots of nice places to visit in Geneva,
and these days the tram goes all the way from CERN.&nbsp; Definitely
don't drive, because parking can be a nightmare.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services/am-bahnhof/railway-stations/geneva-station.html">Cornavin (train station)</a>/<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_du_Mont-Blanc">Pont du Mont Blanc</a>/<a href="http://switzerland-geneva.com/attractions/quaiwwilson.html">Quai Wilson</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Take the tram to the train station,
which opens onto a public mall that will lead you down to the
lake.&nbsp; Lots of bars and restaurants.&nbsp; Touristy but fun.&nbsp;
Great
place to people watch. Because of the large number of international
organizations and Swiss neutrality, you'll see groups and combinations
of people that are literally not possible anywhere else in the world.<br>
<br>
Of course, the big landmark in that area is the <a href="http://www.geneva.info/jet-d-eau-fountain/">Jet d'Eau</a> in the lake. <br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://switzerland-geneva.com/attractions/oldtown.html">Old Town</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Old walled part of Geneva.&nbsp; On a
hill accross the Pont du Mont Blanc from the train station (easy
walk).&nbsp; Great to walk around and sight see.&nbsp; Some very good
(and <span style="font-style: italic;">very expensive)</span>
restaurants.&nbsp; There's an old church, which isn't much by European
standards (the Calvanists were pretty spartan decorators), but there
are some <a href="http://www.lake-geneva-switzerland.com/geneve/explore-the-geneva-cathedral-archaeological-site/">Roman ruins</a> underneath it that are very cool to visit.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.geneva.info/plainpalais/">Plainpalais</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Area near the University of
Geneva.&nbsp; You can get there by tram.&nbsp; Nice place to hang
out.&nbsp; Lots of restaurants and pubs that are reasonably priced, by
Geneva standards.&nbsp; There's a market there on weekends, and frequently other activities.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.paysdevoltaire.com/en">Ferney-Voltaire</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The "big" French town across the
border.&nbsp; Nice place to walk around.&nbsp; You can get there by bus
from CERN.&nbsp; Lots of restaurants and cafes.&nbsp; They have an
enormous <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g196701-d1577381-Reviews-Ferney_Voltaire_Market-Ferney_Voltaire_Ain_Rhone_Alpes.html">farmers' market </a>on Saturdays that you should go to at least once (but beware of pickpockets).&nbsp; You can also visit <a href="http://www.visitvoltaire.com/voltaire%27s_later_life_chateau_ferney.htm">Voltaire's house</a>.<br>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Fun places to visit outside of Geneva<br>
</h2>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.chamonix.net/">Chamonix</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
This is a must while you're at CERN.&nbsp; It's a tourist town near the
Mont Blanc Tunnel.&nbsp; You can drive there from Geneva, or get there
by train.&nbsp; Cool town with beautiful view and lots of nice
restaurants.&nbsp; You should take the <a href="http://www.chamonix.com/montenvers,81,en.html">cog wheel train to the Mer de
Glace glacier</a>.&nbsp; They carve tunnels into the glacier, which are
cool in a tacky sort of way.&nbsp; If it's a nice day, you can take the
cog wheel train up and hike back down, or hike the whole thing if
you're really hardcore.&nbsp; You can also take the <a href="http://www.compagniedumontblanc.fr/fr/presentation-des-sites/aiguille-du-midi">telepherique to
the Aguille du Midi</a>, if you have the time (and money!).&nbsp; <br>
</div>


<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.la-gruyere.ch/en/Gruyeres.html">La Gruyere</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Yes, where the cheese comes from.&nbsp; Obviously, you'll want to eat a
fondue while you're there.&nbsp; It's an almost absurdly picturesque
town, except... <br>

...right in the middle of it is the <a href="http://www.hrgigermuseum.com/index2.php?option=visit">H.R. Giger museum</a>.&nbsp; He's the
talented and deeply disturbed artist who designed the sets and
creatures for "Alien".&nbsp; The cafe looks like the spaceship from the
movie.&nbsp; Definitely a must while you're there.&nbsp; I don't know how to get there without a car.<br>
</div>


<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.chillon.ch/en/index.cfm">Chateau de Chillon</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Very cool old castle on Lake Geneva.&nbsp; The pictures are all
carefully photographed to make it look like it's in the middle of
nowhere, so you'll be a little disappointed when you arrive and realize
it's in a pretty developed area, but once you get inside, it's really
fascinating.<br>
</div>


<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187260-Annecy_Haute_Savoie_Rhone_Alpes-Vacations.html">Annecy</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Cool French tourist town.&nbsp; A fun place to spend a day when the weather's nice.&nbsp; I <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> you can get there by train.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
<h2>Clubs</h2>
CERN has a <a href="http://home.cern/cern-people/clubs">huge number of clubs</a>
that are subsiized by the lab.&nbsp; I you have an interest, the
chances are good that there's a club for it, and that it's a great
deal.&nbsp; For example, when I worked there I joined the <a href="http://club-acc.web.cern.ch/club-acc/">Automobile Club</a>, which included hydraulic lifts and a <span style="font-style: italic;">full time mechanic</span>, and the <a href="http://cern-musiclub.weebly.com/">Music Club</a>, which had a practice area with amps, micophones, a PA system, and even digital recording equipment (in 1990!). <br>
<br>
The <a href="http://club-ski.web.cern.ch/club-ski/">Ski Club</a> is a particularly good deal, if you're there through the winter.<br>
