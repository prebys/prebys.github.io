<h1>
Chess Resources for Beginners</h1></center>

<center><i>Last Updated Feb 18, 2002</i></center>

<p>I put this webpage together to help out the kids and parents in the
Alice Gustafson School Chess Club. It's currently being maintained at <a href="http://home.fnal.gov/~prebys/misc/chessclub/index.html">http://home.fnal.gov/~prebys/misc/chessclub/index.html</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any comments can be sent to <a href="mailto:prebys@fnal.gov">prebys@fnal.gov</a>

<h2>
Disclaimer</h2>
I'm certainly not a chess expert.&nbsp; I'm not even a particularly good
chess player.
<h2>
Basic Rules</h2>

<h2>
Books about Chess</h2>
There are lots of books about chess, many written by famous chess players.
Believe it or not, however,&nbsp; "<font color="#FF0000">The Complete Idiot's
Guide to Chess</font>" is highly recommended. It also gets rave reviews
at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> (5/5 stars). Unfortunately,
when I got to the bookstore I accidentally bought "Chess for Dummies" instead
(now how could I have made that mistake?). It's OK, but not great (4/5
stars at Amazon).
<p>If anyone has other recommendations (for beginners and especially for
children), I'd be happy to list them here.
<h2>
Chess Resources on the Web</h2>
Chess is a game that breeds fanaticism. My search for the word "chess"
on the web returned <i><font color="#FF0000">over two million matches</font></i>
(and now there's one more, I guess). There are whole websites devoted to
single openings or what Garry Kasparov eats for breakfast. I don't want
to reinvent the wheel, but a good starting point is <a href="http://chess.about.com/games/chess/">http://chess.about.com/games/chess/</a>
.&nbsp; It has reasonably well organized pointers to all sorts of chess
material. The "How to Play" link has a nice overview of the rules, both
for kids and for adults trying to keep up with kids.
<p>If anyone else knows of a good one, I'll be happy to add it.
<h2>
Computer Chess Programs</h2>
It's not hard to find a computer chess game that can beat you every time.
There are plenty of free chess programs that can consistently beat anyone
below the Master level. This is because they look many moves in the future
and <i>never make a mistake.</i> In most cases the only way to make them
play "weaker" is to limit the number of moves that they consider and/or
the amount of time they take to consider them, but this is still <i>very</i>
different than playing a human being and of questionable teaching value.
<p>The challenge is finding a computer program that plays like a human
being and also has decent teaching utilities. Based on admittedly limited
experience, I really like <b><font color="#CC0000">"Chessmaster 8000"</font></b>.&nbsp;
Its key features are:
<ul>
<li>
Tutorials to learn the basics, many geared specifically toward children.</li>

<li>
A variety of "drills" at all levels;&nbsp; that is, it sets up particular
situations and you have to find the best move.</li>

<li>
It can play as any one of a large number of "personalities", each with
a particular style ("aggressive", "defensive", etc.) and skill levels ranging
from random play to Grand Master Level.&nbsp; You can even create custom
personalities.&nbsp; When I set it to a personality at my level, I find
it indistinguishable from playing a person.</li>
</ul>
It's very easy to use.&nbsp; My second grader has no trouble at all with
it, and I suspect my kindergartener will be using it soon. You can find
the details at <a href="http://www.chessmaster.com">www.chessmaster.com</a>.
$29.99 at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, but if you look
around the web, you can sometimes find it cheaper without the box.&nbsp;
Runs under Windows&nbsp; (older versions for Mac still available).
<p>There's a great Chess program for kids called Chess Mates.&nbsp; It
starts with the basics and works its way up to some pretty challenging
drills.&nbsp; My kids love it.&nbsp; I found it bundled with some other
programs at <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> for $17.95. Runs
on Windows or Mac.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The most popular free chess programs are "<font color="#FF0000">GNU
Chess</font>" and "<font color="#FF0000">Crafty</font>", both of which
work with the "<font color="#FF0000">Winboard</font>" interface on the
PC. This interface was written by Tim Mann, and you can download it and
the programs from his web page at <a href="http://www.tim-mann.org">http://www.tim-mann.org.</a>
<p>There's also a lot of software info at the about.com site at <a href="http://chess.about.com/games/chess/cs/software/index.htm">http://chess.about.com/games/chess/cs/software/index.htm</a>,
but some of the links seem to be outdated.
<p>As usual, comments are welcome.
