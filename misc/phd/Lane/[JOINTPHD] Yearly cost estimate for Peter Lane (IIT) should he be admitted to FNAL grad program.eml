   Dear Fermilab graduate admissions,

   My best estimate for the cost per year for Peter Lane from IIT, should he be
admitted into the program, is approximately 32k per year.  This is assuming
a tuition cost share from IIT of approximately 4k.  I am not certain of the
cost share amount, but IIT has agreed to cost share some of the tuition, and
it is typically around 4k.  The expenses are itemized below:


   Stipend 21.5k (8k for two semesters, 5.5k for summer)
   24% overhead on stipend, 5,160.00
   Tuition 5,160.00 (5 credits times 1032.00 per credit)

   Total:  31,820.00

   Please feel free to email me if you have any questions.

                                               Linda Spentzouris
