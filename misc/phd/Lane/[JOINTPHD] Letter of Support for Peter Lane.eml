Hello,

I am writing to support the application of Peter Lane to the Accelerator 
PhD program.  I have spoken with Linda Spentzouris and have reviewed his 
qualifications.  Linda has asked, and I am willing to serve as Mr. 
Lane's adviser at Fermilab.

Mr. Lane will work on our continuing program of electron cloud research 
for Project X and other future accelerators.  I expect that his central 
area of involvement will be in building, commissioning, and operating an 
experiment in the Main Injector to determine the suitability of 
materials for suppression of the electron cloud.  Specifically, this 
experiment will involve a section of removable beam pipe, various 
versions would have different potential material.  This material will be 
irradiated by the Main Injector beam and the electron cloud it induces. 
  The apparatus will then have a feature to measure the secondary 
emission yield of the material without breaking the accelerator vacuum.

This station has already been prototyped in collaboration with Cornell 
at the CESR-TA facility.  Most of the parts for the new station have 
already been built and assembled, and will be sent to Fermilab.  The 
apparatus will have to operated in the lab to ensure it is understood. 
Then, it will need to be modified for insertion into the Main Injector. 
This effort is being supported for Project X R&D and has initial 
approval of the Main Injector management.

While his focus will be on the above project, I expect Mr. Lane to be 
peripherally involved in our other Electron Cloud research which 
includes: measurements of the electron cloud density on test segments, 
detection of the electron cloud through microwave phase modulation, a 
new experiment using dipole magnets to investigate all of the above in 
arbitrary magnetic fields, and simulation of the electron cloud 
formation and its impact upon the beam.

Mr. Lane's qualifications and motivation seem well-matched to this 
project, though I have not had the opportunity to personally evaluate 
him outside of reviewing his CV and a personal statement. I believe this 
project is well-suited to the involvement of a graduate student.

Sincerely,

Bob Zwaska
