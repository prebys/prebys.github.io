<h1>Notes on Life at CERN</h1>
A lot of other people are more knowledgeable, but here are some of my random notes about what do while one is working at CERN.<br>
<h2>General</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
France is a bit cheaper than Geneva, when it comes to living or eating
out.&nbsp; There used to be a bigger difference, but it's still true at
some level.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Geneva has a great public transportation system, and driving in the city should be avoided at all costs.<br>
</div>
<h2>Restaurants</h2>
Lots and lots.&nbsp; Here are a few of my favorites.<br>
<br>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Restaurant 1 at CERN</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Not a great restaurant, but they have beer and wine.&nbsp; It's a good place to meet and figure out where to go next<br>
<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.boisjoly.com/?lang=en">Le Bois Joly</a><br>
</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is an absolute must at least once!&nbsp; Up the hills toward the Jura.&nbsp; Good food, deent prices, and an absolutely <span style="font-style: italic;">incredible</span>
view.&nbsp; You can make a day of it and take the telepherique and hike
the Jura, then finish up with dinner.&nbsp; Reservations for the deck
recommended on nice days.<br>
<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.restaurantlecoqrouge.fr/index.php/en/">Le Coq Rouge</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
Right in St. Genis, just across the French border.&nbsp; On the same
square with Charly's Pub (which you'll get to know).&nbsp; Good food,
and the prices aren't bad.&nbsp; The lower priced fixed menu is usually
plenty, and they have a great cheese cart for dessert.<br>
<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.laviation.ch/site/fr/">Cafe Restaurant de L'Aviation</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A CERN tradition.&nbsp; As the name
suggests, it's near the airport.&nbsp; Their specialty is a steak
frites with a heavy garlic cream pepper sauce, called a
"caravelle".&nbsp; It take some time off&nbsp; your life, but it's
worth it.&nbsp; The trick is that is long as there's steak on your
plate, they'll keep bringing you more frites and sauce (although
they're much stingier than they used to be.).<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.pizz-azzurra.fr/">L'Azzura Pizzeria</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Nice, reasonably priced pizza place in Ferney Voltaire, France.&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.rajpoute.fr/en/rest.htm">Rajpoute Indian Restaurant</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Near Ferney Voltaire, in
France.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a lot more Indian restaurants than there
used to be, but when CERN people say "The Indian Restaurant", this is
the one they mean (or may not anymore; I guess there's one right by the
lab). NB: I lived in the Vert Village housing development accross the
street from 90-92.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.bains-des-paquis.ch/">Bain de Paquis</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is a hidden gem.&nbsp; A lot of
CERN people don't even know about it.&nbsp; It's not really a
restaurant.&nbsp; It's a swimming area on a little artificial island on
Lake Geneva, but the cafe has good food at a good price, and the it's a
great place to hang out on a nice day.&nbsp; You have to pay a franc or
two to get in, but it's worth it, whether you swim or not.&nbsp; Not to
be confused with "The Paquis", which is the nearby red light district.<br>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Places to visit in and around Geneva</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Lots of nice places to visit in Geneva,
and these days the tram goes all the way from CERN.&nbsp; Definitely
don't drive, because parking can be a nightmare.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Cornavin (train station)/Pont du Mont Blanc/Quai Wilson</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Take the tram to the train station and walk down to the lake.&nbsp; Lots of bars and restaurants.&nbsp; Touristy but fun.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://switzerland-geneva.com/attractions/oldtown.html">Old Town</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Old walled part of Geneva.&nbsp; On a
hill accross the Pont du Mont Blanc from the train station (easy
walk).&nbsp; Great to walk around and sight see.&nbsp; Some very good
(and <span style="font-style: italic;">very expensive)</span>
restaurants.&nbsp; There's an old church, which isn't much by European
standards (the Calvanists were pretty spartan decorators), but there
are some <a href="http://www.lake-geneva-switzerland.com/geneve/explore-the-geneva-cathedral-archaeological-site/">Roman ruins</a> underneath it that are very cool to visit.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.geneva.info/plainpalais/">Plainpalais</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Area near the University of
Geneva.&nbsp; You can get there by tram.&nbsp; Nice place to hang
out.&nbsp; Lots of restaurants and pubs that are reasonably priced, but
Geneva standards.<br>
</div>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Ferney-Voltaire</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The "big" Frence town across the
border.&nbsp; Nice place to walk around.&nbsp; You can get there by bus
from CERN.&nbsp; Lots of restaurants and cafes.&nbsp; They have an
enormous <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g196701-d1577381-Reviews-Ferney_Voltaire_Market-Ferney_Voltaire_Ain_Rhone_Alpes.html">farmers' market </a>on Saturdays that you should go to at least once (but beware of pickpockets).&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<br>

<h2>Fun places to visit outside of Geneva<br>
</h2>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.chamonix.net/">Chamonix</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
This is a must while you're at CERN.&nbsp; It's a tourist town near the
Mont Blanc Tunnel.&nbsp; You can drive there from Geneva, or get there
by train.&nbsp; Cool town with beautiful view and lots of nice
restaurants.&nbsp; You should take the <a href="http://www.chamonix.com/montenvers,81,en.html">cog wheel train to the Mer de
Glace glacier</a>.&nbsp; They carve tunnels into the glacier, which are
cool in a tacky sort of way.&nbsp; If it's a nice day, you can take the
cog wheel train up and hike back down, or hike the whole thing if
you're really up for it.&nbsp; You can also take the <a href="http://www.compagniedumontblanc.fr/fr/presentation-des-sites/aiguille-du-midi">telepherique to
the Aguille du Midi</a>, if you have the time (and money!).&nbsp; <br>
</div>


<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.la-gruyere.ch/en/Gruyeres.html">La Gruyere</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Yes, where the cheese comes from.&nbsp; Obviously, you'll want to eat a
fondue while you're there.&nbsp; It's an almost absurdly picturesque
town, except... <br>

...right in the middle of it is the <a href="http://www.hrgigermuseum.com/index2.php?option=visit">H.R. Giger museum</a>.&nbsp; He's the
talented and deeply disturbed artist who designed the sets and
creatures for "Alien".&nbsp; The cafe looks like the spaceship from the
movie.&nbsp; Definitely a must while you're there.&nbsp; I don't know how to get there without a car.<br>
</div>


<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.chillon.ch/en/index.cfm">Chateau de Chillon</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Very cool old castle on Lake Geneva.&nbsp; The pictures are all
carefully photographed to make it look like it's in the middle of
nowhere, so you'll be a little disappointed when you arrive and realize
it's in a pretty developed area, but once you get inside, it's really
fascinating.<br>
</div>


<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187260-Annecy_Haute_Savoie_Rhone_Alpes-Vacations.html">Annecy</a></h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Cool French tourist town.&nbsp; A fun place to spend a day.<br>
</div>
