<h1 style="text-align: center;">Notes on Using LabView for DAQ</h1>
<br>
(Last Updated December 14, 2017, by <a href="http://physics.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/eric-prebys">Eric Prebys</a>)<br>
<br>
These notes apply to Windows.&nbsp; I've had less luck running LabView
on MacOS, but it works with the Windows partition on my Mac.<br>
<br>
<h2>Required Software</h2>
It's sometimes difficult to figure out what software you need for LabView DAQ, but the only two pieces you need are<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview/download.html">LabView</a></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Select "Measure Physical Systems..." option</li>
    <li>Currently using LabView2017</li>
    <li>You can get a 7 day free trial version, but extend it to 45 days by creating an account at NI.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><a href="http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/10181">DAQmx</a></li>
  <ul>
    <li>This has the stuff that communicates with hardware, as well as the all-important "DAQ Assistant"</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
No additional software or drivers should be needed to use hardware with LabView<br>
<h2>Connecting to Hardware</h2>
I've tested LabView with a <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.usb-6000.html">USB-6000</a> USB-based module and with a <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.cdaq-9184.html">cDAQ-9184</a> four-slot ethernet-based chassis, populated with <br>
<ul>
  <li>1 x <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.ni-9403.html">NI-9403</a> 32 channel digital IO module</li>
  <li>2 x <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.ni-9205.html">NI-9205</a> 32 channel analog input module</li>
  <li>1 x <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.ni-9201.html">NI-9201</a> 8 channel analog input module</li>
</ul>
When the USB device is connected, the computer should recognize it and download the appropriate drivers.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The ethernet device should just be "discovered" on the local network.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Hardware is managed with the NIMax program, which is installed along
with DAQmx.&nbsp; When you run the progam, you should see USB devices
under "My Computer-&gt;Devices and Hardware", and your ethernet devices
under "My Computer-&gt;Devices and Hardware-&gt;Network Devices".&nbsp;
If it doesn't see it automatically, you may need to go to the
"...Network Devices" page, and click "Add Network Device" at the
top.&nbsp; This should see any networked devices, which you can then
click on and select "Add".&nbsp; Once you add it, it will recognize any
modules as separate devices and load the appropriate drivers.<br>
<br>
<h2>Incorporating DAQ Hardware into LabView Designs</h2>
<br>
The magic tool for inserting DAQ channels into LabView designs is "DAQ
Assistant", this is available on the block diagram with
"(Right-click)-&gt;Measurement I/O-&gt;NI DAQmx-&gt;DAQ
Assistant".&nbsp; The first time you use this, you may get an message
that your software is unlicensed, so you have to click the box that
says you agree to follow the licensing rules, and click next.&nbsp;
Then you will get a pop-up window that allows you to select "Aquire
Signals" or "Generate Signals", and then select analog or digital input
or output (or a bunch of other stuff you probably won't use).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Here are some handy vidoes about how to do simple operations:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSNRG_Ddl1s">Simple Analog Input</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiMXAcXuktM">Digital I/O</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h2>Issues with Running a VM</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As usual, you have to tell the computer to connect the USB device to the Windows VM when you plug it in</li>
  <li>It seems to require that the Windows VM have direct access to the
network, rather than via the default "shared network".&nbsp; This is
done by going to "Devices-&gt;Network1-&gt;LAN (or whatever)".&nbsp;
This doesn't appear to affect anything else</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trouble with Ethernet Connection</h2>
If NIMax doesn't see the ethernet device, check the yellow status
light.&nbsp; It should be off.&nbsp; It is repeating a sequence of
three flashes, it means the firmware is corrupted, and you need to
re-flash it by following the instructions <a href="https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z000000P7flSAC">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Moving the Ethernet Device from One Host to Another</h2>
Ethernet devices can only be used by one host at a time.&nbsp; If you
try to connect to it with another (at least on the same network), you
will get an error in NIMax.&nbsp; The solution is to right-click on the
device in the left-hand menu and select "Reserve this Chassis". <br>
