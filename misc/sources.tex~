\section{Multiple Data Sources}

\subsection{General}

In MiniBooNE, data will come from several separate sources.  At the time of 
this writing, these are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Tank - Primarily the data from the BooNE detector, but also some 
miscellaneous data read out with the same electronics, and trigger information.
\item ACNET - all data from the accelerator data acquisition system which is
associated with MiniBooNE operation.  This data will be come from an XML
server in a well-defined format.  A dedicated computer will read the data
of interest to MiniBooNE.
\item Resistive Wall Monitor (RWM) - this is the monitor for the beam time
profile (bunch structure) just prior to the target. The data acquisition
engine will be a VXI-based 1 GHz oscilloscope, which is
read out with a Linux platform computer.
\item Little Muon Counter (LMC) - the detector to monitor the
small angle muons flux in the decay region, as a measure of the
kaon content of our beam.  Data will be read out from a dedicated
data acquisition computer.
\end{itemize}

In general, all subsystems will read out data every 1.6 $\mu $s spill, and 
it will be necessary to merge this data for analysis.  In addition, some 
subsystems will read out data in between spills, which may be treated
as asynchronous.

The plan is that each subsystem will run a more or less standalone
data acquisition system, which writes data to locally accessible file.
All data will be GPS timestamped for use in subsequent merging. Because
we are only interested in merging data from a particular spill, and
spills are 67 ms apart, a timestamp accuracy of 1 ms or so is more
than sufficient.

The individual data acquisition systems will be controlled by the
``\"{U}berDAQ'' to insure that the data from all the systems has the
same run boundaries; however, sub-run boundaries may vary from system
to system.

\section{Run Control}

Operationally, the integrity of the tank data takes 
precedence over everything else.  For that reason, the
