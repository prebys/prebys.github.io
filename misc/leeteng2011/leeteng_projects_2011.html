<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Material Data Compilation for Modeling
of Superconducting Magnets</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentors: <a href="mailto:bocian@FNAL.GOV">Dariusz Bocian</a>, <a
 href="mailto:giorgioa@FNAL.GOV">Giorgio Ambrosio</a>, Technical
Division</li>
    <li>Intern: <a href="mailto:daan0401@STCLOUDSTATE.EDU">Andrew
Davies</a>, St. Cloud State University</li>
    <li>Description: A Network Model is used to study the thermal
behavior of magnet coils and to calculate the quench levels of the
superconducting magnets. One of the vital components of the model is
the cryogenic materials data used in simulation.&nbsp; Materials data
are essential input of Network Model. In order to prepare this input
and to study of model sensitivity on different material properties
parameterizations a material data compilation is required. The
collected data will be implemented into thermal magnet model. Then, the
simulated data with Network Model will be compared with available
experimental results.&nbsp; The results of the work will be used to
calculate the thermal behavior of superconducting magnets as well as to
assess the magnet components crucial to heat transfer in the
magnet.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Intern: <a href="mailto:cookc@UWEC.EDU">Cole Cook</a>,
University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire</li>
    <li>Description: Assist in analysis of test results and participate
in future test of singe cell Superconducting RF cavities. There is a
modest R&amp;D program here to both understand performance and
investigate the underlying physics of these devices.&nbsp;</li>

cavity</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentor: <a href="mailto:tsen@fnal.gov">Tanaji Sen</a>,
Accelerator Physics Center</li>
    <li>Intern: <a href="mailto:keren.li@STONYBROOK.EDU">Keren Li</a>,

  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Detection of the Electron Cloud with
Ultraviolet Light&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentor: <a href="mailto:zwaska@fnal.gov">Bob Zwaska</a>,
Accelerator Physics Center</li>
    <li>Intern: <a href="mailto:sepflug@ILSTU.EDU">Sarah Pfluger</a>,
Illinois State University</li>
    <li>Description:This project focuses on using ultraviolet light as
an alternative detection technique for the election cloud.&nbsp; Light
will be emitted as the electrons bombard the surface.&nbsp; The
advantage of this technique is that it may allow imaging of the impact
process within a dipole magnet where there is no room for other
equipment.&nbsp; The student will use an electron gun and
photospectrometer to benchmark this effect, and work on a concept for
implementaiton in the Main Injector.</li>

  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Microwave Transmission Technique for
Measuring E-cloud</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentore: <a href="mailto:jtobin@fnal.gov">Charles Thangaraj</a>,
Acclerator Physics Center</li>
    <li>Intern: <a href="mailto:wang24h@MTHOLYOKE.EDU">Hexuan Wang</a>,
Mt. Holyoke University</li>
    <li>Description:For the summer project, the student will work on
the setting up standing waves inside an elliptical pipe.&nbsp; The test
stand with a beam pipe will be provided.&nbsp; The major work of the
student is to measure transmission properties of the elliptical beam
pipe for various end aperture geometry using a network analyzer.&nbsp;
The student will systematically vary the orientation of the aperture
(horizontal or vertical), polarization of the electric field (vertical
or horizontal) width and the frequency of the exciting field and
measure the reflection coefficient for these settings. The student
should be able to experimentally show the aperture widths, orientation
and electric field polarization for which the desired goals of the
reflection coefficients are achieved.&nbsp; At the end of the work, the
student will write a report and present the results to the electron
cloud group in Fermilab. Through this project, the student will gain
good knowledge on modern accelerators and its issues and gain
experimental skills on RF measurements. &nbsp;</li>

<h2>Argonne <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">(final
match in progress)</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Ultra-High Vacuum and Photocathodes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentor: &nbsp;<a href="mailto:zyusof@anl.gov">Zeke Yusof</a></li>
    <li>Intern: TBD</li>
    <li>Description: The planned program consists of two separate but
connected projects. The <br>
first project will be for the student to learn about ultra-high vacuum
(UHV) <br>
system, and to be able to handle and assemble components for a UHV
system. <br>
This includes learning about vacuum pumps, UHV "hygiene", proper design
of <br>
UHV components, putting together vacuum components, etc. <br>
The second project is on photocathodes for accelerators. The student
will <br>
learn about cesium telluride photocathode and will learn how to produce
such <br>
a photocathode for the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility. In
addition, <br>
analysis of the characteristics of the photocathode will be part of the
      <br>
project..

Simulation &nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentor:<a href="mailto:bxyang@aps.anl.gov">Bingxin Yang</a></li>
    <li>Intern: TBD</li>
    <li>Desciption: Calculate the x-ray fluorescence
intensity for APS undulators (5.0 cm, 3.3 cm, 2.5 cm, and 1.8 mm) from
a photon
beam dump and photon XBPM as a function of undulator magnetic gap.
Simulation
studies for different instrument settings such as undulator beam
apertures,
beam angle, dump material, and detector distances. Simple experimental
test may
be designed and performed when time permits.
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Skills:Proficient in the use of computers for numerical
calculations. Experience in computer programming is helpful, especially
in languages Tcl or Python.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Storage ring emittance optimization
with longitudinal dipole gradient&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentor: <a href="mailto:wangcx@aps.anl.gov">Chun-xi Wang</a></li>
    <li>Intern: TBD</li>
    <li>Description: After learning some basics of beam emittance in
electron storage rings (here and at the USPAS) the student will compute
the theoretical minimum emittance with nonuniform dipoles for different
analytical models of the profile. Then the student will explore dipole
magnet design using the software RADIA to study the feasibility of the
optimal dipole bending profile and associated nonlinear field.&nbsp;
Optionally the student could study the fringe field model of APS
magnets.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Skills:Familiarity with Mathematica is required for this
study.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">EPICS Device Driver for an Insertion
Device</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentor: <a href="mailto:rif@aps.anl.gov">Richard Farnsworth</a>
(AES Controls)</li>
    <li>Intern: TBD</li>
    <li>Description:EPICS is a set of open source software tools for
the distributed control of scientific instruments such as particle
accelerators, telescopes, and large scientific experiments. This
project involves writing an EPICS Device driver for use on an insertion
device, which is the source of the bright x-rays at the APS. The
project will involve the student learning about EPICS and in particular
the techniques involving driver templates called the ASYN device drive
or the Stream I/O driver. They will be asked to research the problem
before arriving as EPICS is well documented and is available open
source. The device for which the student has developed the driver will
be used on an insertion device. The Student will be asked to
exhaustively test the driver in the Labs at the APS and under the
supervision of experienced engineers.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Skills:Exposure or experience with C, C++, Java, or scripting
languages is good. Experience with Linux (or other UNIX) is a
plus.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Nanoradian Slope Measuring Profiler
Development OR Nanofocusing Mirror Performance Simulation&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Mentor: <a href="mailto:assoufid@aps.anl.gov">Lahsen Assoufid</a>
(XSD Optics/Detectors)&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Intern: TBD</li>
    <li>Description1: The project involves assisting in developing a
nanoradian slope measuring profiler for x-ray mirror surface
characterization. X-ray mirrors are devices used to collimate and focus
the x-ray beams at the APS and this project is centered around a new
state-of-the-art instrument critical to quantifying the surface quality
of beamline mirrors. To put things into perspective a nanoradian angle
would only yield enough field of view to watch a 15&rdquo; television
from the moon!</li>
    <li>Skills1: Requires (a little strong I think CAP) knowledge of
basic optics and data acquisition and control using LabView.</li>
    <li>Description 2: This project involves assisting in developing an
existing wave optics computer program to simulate the performance of
nanfocusing x-ray mirrors. Nanofocusing optics are important components
on APS bealines, allowing scientists to delve into the behaviors of
materials at the nanoscale. The code is written in both IDL and Fortran
versions.</li>
    <li>Skills 2:Analytical programming experience is a plus, as is
exposure to Fortran or IDL.</li>
